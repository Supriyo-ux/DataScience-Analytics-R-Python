Life Insurance,Bharti AXA Life Insurance,Bhawna,Delhi,"December 21, 2015",Bharti AXA life insurance is best,5,"I just bought Bharti axa life insurance plan from Policybazaar and wanted to give review for the product. As of now what I have got info that Bharti axa is good company which has a reputation of good claim ratio. I am a house wife still I save much money and invested on money back policy with good returns. I liked it because policybazaar provided me instant paper on my email id and they are very supportive and cleared my confusion. Its very difficult to buy if you are comparing so many insurance plans from insurance companies. However, its better to buy by comparing because you can actually find the plan on your budget. Bharti axa has a very good reputation and they are a kind of new in this so investment on this is a good decision. Thanks!  "
Life Insurance,Bharti AXA Life Insurance,Vivek,Delhi,"December 18, 2015",Bought a Bharti axa term plan for 10 years,4,"I am an civil engineer just got a job in an MNC at Delhi, one of my very close friend suggested me to buy a term insurance, I was unaware about such term insurance existence in this world. So I searched on Google and found policybazaar. After reading all the info from there I found it is very essential for me to get a term insurance because I have many responsibilities towards my family. Also, as I have taken education loan so its very much in need because it will take at least 10 years to establish myself in this society. Therefore I choose Bharti axa because again the premium is cheap and terms are best... Also I really thankful to Policybazaar for their excellent customer care and right information’s.
