Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Very Poor Customer Service”,2,10/20/2014,10/20/2014,We were here for a weekend with college friends. The place matched our requirements as it was remote (3+ kms from main road) and there is a natural waterfall on the side of the resort itself. That was the only good thing. Everything else was poor to terrible.1) Customer Service - very poor. There was no proper response for any requests. Everything arrived late or never.2) Cottages - not at all maintained. Rooms were not cleaned and bathroom had no soap but a stinking bath towel.3) Food was the worst part of it. Even coffee and tea was tasting really horrible. Everything was made just enough and of below average taste.Overall I do not recommend this place to anyone. Even if you want to booze out a weekend; unless the food and place to sleep is not good; you can't enjoy it.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Nothing Great about this place”,3,09-03-2014,09/03/2014,I had been to this place in July '14 for my first anniversary after seeing reviews in tripadvisor. It was on 4.5 stars then and at the time of writing this review; it has dropped to 4. Reason being; there is nothing great about this place. The accommodation is average; with lots of cobwebs in the ceiling. I first took the wood house for the first night & then shifted to the Bamboo house for the second because I didn't like the wood house. But the Bamboo house too turned out to be a dampener.The saving grace was the waterfall in the property & the excellent food served there.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Not a good place for family”,2,08-03-2014,08/03/2014,I will not recommend this for family trip .I choose this resort based on the rating from Tripadvisor but it is surely over rated .There was no security;no reception and not even proper staffs. Rooms were below average (Twin Cottage ) and not even having proper storage space and a ceiling fan . We checked in on a Sunday and checked out on a Monday . Since majority of their rooms were vacant they didn't prepare buffet food for us and prepared separate food which I will rate as below average .Only good thing about this resort is the waterfall which is passing through the plantation area.But I will not recommend anyone to choose this resort only for that Waterfall.,via Web,Jul-14,with family,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,Rosmem,"Bangalore, India",5,5,4,8,7,Room Tip: I will not recommend this resort,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1232778-d1970382-r219239267-Coffea_Aroma_Resort_Wayanad-Kalpetta_Wayanad_District_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Breathtaking location !”,4,06-06-2014,06/06/2014,The resort has a fantastic location - right in the middle of hundreds of acres of coffee plantations and forest. To reach the hotel; you have to travel 3.5 Kms on a dirt road; meant for SUVs / four-wheelers. Wild elephants often cross this dirt road and the management advises guests to return while there is daylight (which was 6.00 pm in May). The flip side is that you are forced to have dinner at the hotel which has limited fare; depending on the occupancy. The resort has a waterfall (tiny in May) within the resort premises. Surprisingly for a coffee plantation resort; the coffee served was hardly worth mentioning! The staff; while keen to help; requires training and has limited language range (unless you are familiar with a South Indian language!).Feedback for management: Need to train the staff on housekeeping (had to ask for towels - and when they were provided; had to ask once again for toiletaries which are pathetic for the room charges). Need to improve the quality of meals compared to the charges (Rs 200 per person for dinner) - excellent breakfast provided.,via Web,Jun-14,with family,4,5,5,3,3,3,RoadrunnerMumbai,Mumbai,5,3,3,2,1,Room Tip: If you like to sleep with a background noise of a falling water; choose cottages B1 / B2.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Great resort”,5,05-05-2014,05/05/2014,Had been to Coffea Aroma resort the first weekend of May and stayed for two nights in the Bamboo cottage.The resort lies inside a coffee estate and gives you this very good feel about being amidst nature. The Bamboo cottage added to this feel.Staff is very courteous. All you have to do is ask and they will be ready to help you out. It rained heavily one of the evenings we were there and we were served hot onion Pakodas on request. Dinner and breakfast were also very delicious. Limited variety; but tasty nonetheless. What more would you expect of a resort in the middle of the forest.The resort is about 4 kms away from the main road saw mill stop. The road to get to the estate is unpaved and a little adventurous. Might be difficult to do this stretch during peak monsoons; But on regular days; even a Maruti 800 would be able to do it without breaking a sweat. In case you are the type who wouldn't want to drive there; they will arrange for their jeep to pick you up and also provide for a parking spot near the main road.There is a stream running right next to the resort which would be an amazing sight to watch during peak monsoons. Water levels weren't really high when we were there as the monsoon hadn't set in yet.They also have a small open area with Carroms; TT and Shuttle cock to play with and a small trampoline for the kids. They also have a natural pool formed by the water from the stream.Perfect getaway from the city hustle.,via Web,May-14,as a couple,5,5,5,4,4,5,ashwinbhatt,"Bangalore, India",10,9,9,3,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1232778-d1970382-r204083438-Coffea_Aroma_Resort_Wayanad-Kalpetta_Wayanad_District_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

They try to accomodate your requests for specific menu too. Set inside the coffee estate; and beside the water falls (though the water level was very low when I visited); this place is certainly for those who want to get away from the bustling city. Rooms are average and needs some maintenance; but they make it up with their excellent hospitality. Tips: It is 2-3 km inside the estate from main road and I had a tough time driving inside (boards are not well placed). The resort can arrange a safe parking on the main road and drive you to the suites by jeep. Use directions given by the resort website.

It was a bit hard to find the place since sign board to turn off the main road was small; but a friend had come here before so he remembered the timber yard which was used as a waypoint. The resort is about 3km off the main road and in middle of coffee plantations. You might have trouble bringing smaller cars since the road leading to resort from main road is not paved.Once you reach the resort the good stuff begins. Resort is very peaceful and in middle of nature with a waterfall very close to it. The service from the staff is commendable; they did not hesitate to accommodate any of our requests. The rooms are fairly large but the quality is average but thats what you want staying at a place like this. Bathrooms were clean and hot water is available. Each cottage is placed at a distance from others so privacy is not a problem. They have a common area with some games to play like table tennis etc.Food was amazing!!!

Approach from main road is rough so it is better to park your car in the church premise by the main road (the SUVs can take it easily). The pros-+ Resort facility is very good including the picturesque stream and small waterfall; play area with the trampoline (a hit with my kids); table tennis; carom; string tennis & shuttle; and watch tower and lots and lots of trees in the coffee plantations.+ wood house was well built with a sit out offering good privacy for peaceful reading on the porch or even meditation :)+ Akhil was very friendly and even showed the pets in the facility (dogs; birds) to my kids.+ There seems to be a good spa but we could not use it. You will have to plan ahead and book the service so that the management could arrange for the spa treatment accordingly. + The pick up and drop service in a Mahindra jeep from / to resort & church on the main road (about 3 KM) is dependable and well organized by the management.The cons-- Food was very average and the tables in the café could be kept cleaner.- The natural pool formed by the stream is clean but has a few mosquitos so beware. We spent an hour by the falls (there are 3 levels of the falls) and my kids enjoyed playing under the falls.- Prices of beverages are a tad higher so bring in your beverages including bottled water.- if you decide to spend the entire day in the resort lunch options are limited.Places we visited- Close to Pookut lake (less than 20KM); banasura dam (35KM).

The room was extremely dirty and damp; the ceiling which must be originally white had turned black with fungal growth which resulted in a strong damp smell in the cottage and it was impossible to stay inside even for couple of minutes. Room spray did not help with the smell. There was a thin carpet which has never seen a laundry ever and had it is own addition of dust and aroma to add the cottage's cleanliness. The basic hygine and room service was poor. The outlet from the only wash basin leaked all the over the floor. The bedsheets and blankets were smelly and dirty!!!!!!Though the location was nice one could not enjoy because of inadequate maintenance and cleanliness.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Family Outing”,3,11-11-2013,11/11/2013,Located amidst 6000 acre dense coffee estate; Coffea Aroma is a paradise; especially when it is raining. It is situated 3 kms from the main road and reaching the place is an off roaders dream. We were a family of 5 travelling from Bangalore; in a hatchback. So we were promptly advised by Akhil (The guy who manages the resort) to take their Jeep ride from the main road; instead of struggling in our vehicle on that bumpy road to reach the resort. Akhil is a very accommodative person; he allowed 5 heads to stay at the cost of 4; without charging anything extra for the stay or food. Akhil and Benny are always out there if you need them; EVEN if it is bang in the middle of the night; like it happened with us. My mum had trouble breathing (may be because of altitude change) and they rushed to us within three minutes of calling at like 3:30 in the night; very courteous of them. Regarding the stay; I believe that the Twin Cottages that we had rented requires maintenance. The cottage needs some renovation done; as the persistent rain that Wayanad has received during the last 5 months might have caused damage to the walls - they look damp and dull. The Rooms need some brighter shade of painting; which will definitely give a better look. Bathrooms were pretty well maintained though; with the facility of a Geyser; which is an absolute must during the Rainy and Winter seasons. Likes:1. LOCATION - Coffee plantations; Streams and Waterfalls 2. Jeep Ride to the resort3. Service - people were helpful4. Value for moneyScope for Improvement1.

Hospitality was good and staffs are polite. the resort is near to chembra peak you can do trekking from the resort the food is good only if you tell how you want it. if you like kerala type dish then its OK.Disadvantage: Its 4 to 5 km inside main road. the roads are humpty dumpty.Pick and drop: they charged 800 from us.They arranged cab facility for us 2 days and charged 3600.i feel that is costly because we didn't go more than 120 km from 2 days.first day they charged 1600 and second day 2000. i asked why ? they said you traveled lot in second day.without showing how many kilometer we traveled. i went for vacation with family so i didn't quarrel.If you have your own vehicle; this was the place to hangout and spend most memorable time with your family.,via Web,May-13,with family,4,5,4,3,4,4,KiranMGowda,"Bangalore, India",1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1232778-d1970382-r159866586-Coffea_Aroma_Resort_Wayanad-Kalpetta_Wayanad_District_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

It was an excellent location with green surroundings and cool climate. The main attraction in this resort is the Waterfalls through the majestic rochs and the stream below. We can have the view of misty Chembra peak from the stream. This view itself is worth. The rooms are good and unique. All made in differtent themes. We stayed at Twin cottages which was economical. The restaurent is facing the stream and the view of jungle opposite is a different experience. You will have the feeling of being inside a jungle with the sound of chirping birds and view of trees surroundings. Being inside the coffee plantation makes it look green everywhere.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Peaceful place”,4,1/21/2013,1/21/2013,We a family of 6 members stayed at Coffea Aroma during the last week of december 2012. It is a peaceful place to calm your nerves from the hectic city life. Few of my views on the resort are listed below :1. One has to travel for around 20 min from the main road(off-road) to reach the resort. The journey is through Coffee plantations and this is a different exp.2. The resort is situated within a coffee estate of around 12 acres; so there is no noise of vehicles and other things.3. The rooms are kept clean and the room services were good. There is no extension facility.4. There are facilities to play games like table tennis; caroms; badminton etc.5. The food is very good; its more like homely food.6. The resort has got natural stream with pools which are excellent; I pick this one to be the best facility at Coffea Aroma.7. A walk of around 30 min. through coffee and tea plantations will take one to the base from where the trek to Chembra peak starts. A walk to this place during the golden hours through the tea plantations will be really awesome.8. The people around for service are friendly and are really helpful to know Wayanad better.Overall it was really a great experience.,via Web,Dec-12,with family,4,5,5,4,4,4,sant12345,"Bangalore, India",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1232778-d1970382-r150192692-Coffea_Aroma_Resort_Wayanad-Kalpetta_Wayanad_District_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Indulge in with nature!”,4,1/20/2013,1/20/2013,Frankly; Coffea aroma was chosen as a backup plan for Vythiri resorts as they were houseful when we went. A typical expected kind of Wayanad plantation stay with standalone huts and no concrete bricks to create boredom. Don't expect a luxurious family stay with kids or else you end up coming back sick. Go with friends or couple on a most rainy day; make sure to take your 4 wheel drive car; camera and lot of woolen clothes. Staying in that wooden house; stay awake till middle of night and enjoy the rain. Food was homely style OK.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“A real taste of Wayanad- Coffea Aroma”,5,1/16/2013,1/16/2013,Had a year end vacation at Wayanad with friends. The place for stay was selected was Coffea aroma resort; as we got a good feedback from a friend who has stayed there earlier. We drove through the majestic Wayanad Ghats connecting Calicut and Wayanad. The plantation road leading to the resort was an offroad experience. But we could drive our Wagor R through the way without much difficulty and was a different experience. We selected the deluxe twin cottage which is located in a separate area from the main entrance. These cottages were newly constructed one and was neatly kept. There is a sit out and is surrounded by greenery. The most beautiful part is to see the location early with thick mist in the area. The natural pool of the resort was also close to our cottages. We could also see a watch tower constructed to keep an eye on animals entering the plantation nearby. There are othr cottages where all cottages were built differently like wood housem; tree house etc. The cottage in farther corner named as Honeymoon cottage will be the best as it is located facing the waterfalls. The food was good and it was a buffet as there were many guests. The restaurent was large enough for the group. We could see the children having a good time at the Trampolene and punch bag in the indoor games area. We played badminton in the ground. The resort arranged us a Jeep as requested for our local sightseeing. We could cover the Pookode lake; Banasurasagar Dam and Soochippara falls.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Simple & Decent Place”,4,01-04-2013,01/04/2013,Stayed here at CoffeaAroma during New Year along with my friends and their families. We were 5 families; 10 adults and 4 kids.Location (1 Star):Its located close to Kalpetta; between Chundale and Meppadi. You will have to do off-roading for about 2-3 KMs to reach the resort. Vehicles with lower ground clearance will have some problem climbing. Tourist spots like Pookote Lake; Soochipara Falls; Lakkadi View point are at about 30-40 mins travel. Very calm; pleasant place with the view of Forest; mountains. Rooms (0.5 Star):Since our plan got finalized just before 2 weeks from New Year; we didn't get the much wanted Tree house or Wood house. What we got is Deluxe Twin Cottage. This cottage is newly constructed and rooms were clean and decent. But one of my friend was not happy with the room given to him as it was not clean. Very basic room. Nothing fancy here. There were power cuts as well and i don't think this resort has any power backup. Sometimes in the evenings; power cuts was very annoying. Service (1 Star):Service was awesome. We asked for Kerala delicacies and they provided it for breakfast. They even arranged Kerala Sendai melam during New Year Eve. Folks were really helpful. Thumps Up.Food (0.5 Star):After reading all below reviews; our expectations very little high. But to be honest; the food was just average. Not much spread. Very standard; bland menu for all meals. Our Driver who has visited this place sometime ago told us that Food used to be very good. Looks like the cook has changed. Food was only good in parts. Veg folks didn't had much options. Coffee they served was absolutely without any Aroma/taste which was totally disappointing :( Overall; Its Just OK.Amenities (1 Star):Its a resort. That's what they call it. So; there has to be amenities right? :). There is. More of Indoor games like Chess; Carom; Dart board etc. They also have Shuttle; Cricket kits. But didn't find much open place to play.Highlight of the resort is the stream that runs close by. This place is absolutely wonderful. Just within few mins walk; you will find a small water falls where we took an amazing bath. The water was very cold. One extra star for this stream/Water fall.Overall; a decent stay at CoffeaAroma. CoffeaAroma is more of a Home stay than a resort. My rating would be 3 + 1 stars (+1 is for the stream/Water fall).,via Web,Dec-12,with family,3,4,3,3,4,5,bsundar1,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",15,7,8,9,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1232778-d1970382-r148770821-Coffea_Aroma_Resort_Wayanad-Kalpetta_Wayanad_District_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“A perfect weekend getaway..”,4,12/27/2012,12/27/2012,My husband and I zeroed in on Coffee Aroma resort for our much awaited weekend getway.. The concept and the cost suited us perfectly and we were on our way to coffee aroma on a friday. To be honest; getting to the resort is a bit daunting; as we have to do a little off-roading through a road which actually takes us through the coffee estate itself. People with cars with lesser ground clearance can request the manager to arrange for pick up from the main road. Once we landed in the resort; we were amazed at the lush greenery surrounding us. The rooms are very hygenic and the staff are quite friendly and helpful. Since we landed on a friday; we got to enjoy a lot of attention and the food was cooked as per our wish; which was quite tasty. There were more guests during the weekend; but still our privacy was maintained. They also have some indoor and outdoor game options. My husband and I had a great time playing badminton there. The resturant is next to a natural waterfall which makes the dining experience quite amazing as there is a continuous sound of flowing water in the background which was extremely relaxing and refreshing. There was a campfire arranged with some music to accompany it which was much needed for the December chill.

The resort is situated in the middle of green nature and coffee plantation. The resort manager Mr.Akhil will arrange jeep for drop/pick up and also for sight seeing.

They do prepare evening snacks on request. When we returned to resort from sight seeing around 6 in the evening; and requested them to prepare some snacks; they were ready with hot onion pakodas by 10-15 mins when we came to restaurant place after getting refreshed. The natural water falls inside resort is a main attraction(only if you go in rainy season; I have heard from friends who went in Feb that there was no water at all). While we sit in open restaurant (with roof top) in the evening with hot pakodas; sound of floating water; and continuous humming of birds will just enlighten our minds. Though prices in the website are quite more; we can request/bargain and make it little less. Sight seeing changes were 1400 and 1900 for half day and full day(in jeep) respectively.. I am not sure whether it is ok or more. Only difficulty is the 3KM mud road with very much ups and downs to reach the resort from the main road.

Coffea Aroma Resort - Wayanad Meppadi,“Beautiful place with personal attention”,4,1/29/2012,1/29/2012,Pros:This is a lovely place nestled in a coffee plantation. The owner is a very simple and welcoming person. It is nothing very fancy but what especially impressed us was the care and attention that reflected in the maintenance of that resort. The cottages are very cute and creative; with different settings like two near the stream; one as a tree hut; a wooden cottage with very local architecture etc. It was also value for money at around 2500/- per night for a couple. For a resort in the center of a coffee plantation in the middle of rains; it was surprisingly clean. And the stream in the middle of the resort was beautiful. Cons:The one issue with this resort is the approach road -- which is a 2km gravel path; this can be a big issue if you are taking your personal car. The resort people did offer that we could park before the beginning of that approach road and they would come to pick us up; but we did not try that option so cannot say how that would have worked out.

The transport and sight-seeing was arranged for us (and is pretty cheap; I must add) and we had no difficulty going to and from the bus station.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Private; natural setting & kind hosts”,4,08-06-2014,08/06/2014,We stayed two nights here (the one on the cliff; #2?) and enjoyed the tranquility; quiet; and natural setting. Our hosts and cooks were kind and helpful. Our room was spacious and comfortable; with a large bathroom and a ceiling fan. There were two entrances to the room; one at the back that went out to the back patio; where you could see the ocean and hear the waves crashing; and no one else was around. It was great.There is a somewhat rickety staircase that leads down the cliff to the beach; which has a lot of large boulders on it and a pretty strong current (at least when we were there). Not sure I'd swim; but it was fun to hop among the rocks and watch the sun set.We had dinner and breakfast on the covered patio beside the building; and it was always delicious. Our host helped set up a visit for us to a nearby temple to witness a theyyam (a religious ritual northern Malabar is known for; and Kannur specifically). He called a rickshaw for us and really arranged everything. That was a great experience; so definitely do it if you visit!The place is a bit of a ride from the train station; and the roads aren't paved once you get out of town.

Food is served dutifully at the appropriate time. .Mr. Kurien; the manager is very nice and helpful. He booked my stay in the next town I was visiting; and also changed dollars into rupees for me at an excellent rate. He is an expert on Theyyam; and arranged a visit to a Theyyam ritual by auto. Clothes came back clean in a day. Food was excellent.That being said; I was under the impression that this was a homestay; but this is only a house in which you can stay. The only human contact I had was with the cook who dutifully called me thrice a day with \Saar; food.\"" I was not given any pointers on places to visit; or a map. Not even directions to Thottada beach. I got lost in both Thottada and Adikatalayi village. All the roads look the same; narrow and winding through greenery; and nobody speaks English. I walked around in circles in the heat and somehow made it back to the house; thanks to some help from an elite-looking businessman in a white van. I didn't venture out again.I was not warned about the strong monsoon current in the sea. so when I ventured onto the beach bellow the house; I was swept to the ground by a giant wave that hurt my leg badly. There was nobody else in the house because Mr. Saar Food wasn't going to return till dinnertime. Mr. Kurien gave me ayurvedic ointment later; and the cook; when he arrived; gave me ice in a plastic bag; but I was lying by myself and groaning for hours; listening to the waves. I'm just glad didn't get swept into the sea; as nobody would have missed me for hours.So; Costa Malabari is for those who are really into Theyyam. It is also for people who want to experience what Nelson Mandela and other famous leaders must experience during house arrest.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Basic with something special”,4,5/13/2014,5/13/2014,I was at Costa Malabari on a yoga retreat. The rooms are clean and basic though this doesn't mean uncomfortable by any stretch. The food was amazing and the staff really wanted to make the stay the best they could. It got very hot on a couple of nights due to the electricity failing - these things happen. One of the assets of the place is Kurian - the owner and an amazing host. His passion is wanting to make your stay the best possible. He is very proud of the local area and obviously loves history. Kurian arranged transport quickly and is a mine of information about what to do; where to go and how to get there. The resort is near the beach and the village is a short walk away. The people there were incredibly welcoming and friendly - you'll have your photo taken all the time if you're from Europe. I wouldn't return simply because there is so much of India still to explore. For my first taste though; I'm grateful to the people at Costa Malabari here who made it so memorable.,via Web,Feb-14,with friends,4,4,4,4,4,5,martpt,Kent England,22,14,14,1,NA,Room Tip: Ask for on elf the corner rooms - they are larger.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r205382022-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Costa Malabari Kannur,“Nice little homely place”,3,4/20/2014,4/20/2014,"Stayed there for just one night last month. The caretaker; Mr. Kurian was very helpful and provided proper guidance - the best route to/from bangalore / places to visit in town. He even mentioned the pros/cons of another hotel when we checked out :) . There are 3 costa malabaris - i stayed in no. 2 which is (almost) right at the beach. You only have to walk down through the stairs and the beach is there. Also; the beach is almost like a private beach. You can also enjoy the see breeze and the sound of the waves crashing the seashore lying on the hammock in the garden. As far as the food is concerned; having tasted kerala cuisine earlier; i liked all the 3 meals i had there. Note that even though the hotel we later moved to is supposed to be a \3 star\"" one (Surya residency) and then we had dinner buffet in an even more plush hotel (Hotel Central Avenue); the food that i had here was easily the best. This we realized on day two only :). The biggest problem was the weather - it was way too hot and humid - nothing specific to this homestay obviously - but please do check out the local weather before you arrive here. Also; location wise there is a disadvantage that its quite difficult to access this location at night because of the somewhat remote location/lack of proper street lights.""",via Web,Apr-14,as a couple,4,4,3,3,3,5,ANZ2,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",7,NA,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r201871259-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Clean rooms away from the beach”,4,03-07-2014,03/07/2014,We enjoyed our stay at Costa Malabari #1 (about 5 mins walk from the beach). The rooms were clean and comfortable; with mosquito nets (appreciated but unneeded). The food was mostly nice; though several times it had been cooked too far in advance and was served cold. Also; the serving style was a bit too formal for our tastes (a server went around to each guest to serve each dish). However; we appreciated that all meals were included (and mostly vegetarian!). The beach itself was ok; but we preferred to stay in the hammocks near the house instead. We went to a Theyyem ceremony; which was absolutely worth it. However; the owner had arranged for our transport but did not communicate with the driver about the price. He told us it should cost ~200-250rs and the driver insisted on 400rs. We had a similar issue when we took the rickshaw to the local weaving workshop (recommended); as the owner had not set a price in advance with the driver and we had to negotiate ourselves. As we only had to pay 200rs from the Kannur train station to the homestay; it was strange to pay much more for far shorter local journeys.Otherwise; the owner was helpful and talkative and the wifi was great.,via Web,Feb-14,as a couple,4,5,5,5,5,3,jimmy009,"Perth, Australia",6,6,6,4,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r196522208-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

The clifftop property (Costa 2) has a beach below that will feel like it's your private stretch of golden sand.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Really excellent place”,5,1/25/2014,1/25/2014,I stayed in the main building. It is a bit further from the beach than nearby accommodations; but the distance is not far and a levee built after the tsunami prevents any property from being truly beach front. The immediate surroundings consist of a coconut palm canopy and there are lots of nice walks in the area as well as the beach; which is relatively clean and unspoiled. Full board is included and the food is excellent and makes this a very good value. The location is about 20-30 minutes from the center of Kannur--there seem to be 2 routes depending on your destination: one goes through the old fishing quarter on rough roads; while the other cuts over to the road from Wayanad. I went to a Theyyam performance and also did a brief half day tour of Kannur (visiting weavers; the fort; etc. which was enough to get the highlights). The guesthouse is designed to promote interaction among the guests and this was on of the most pleasant stays I had in Kerala.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“An experience”,3,1/25/2014,1/25/2014,"This whole review must be taken in the context of what it is - a very simple guesthouse. Physically the 'hotel' is nothing much to talk about...very basic (yet clean) rooms. No amenities at all. There is wifi and hot water. The food is all home-made and was tasty but unremarkable aside from it being served on a banana leaf. The interesting thing here is the location (we stayed at the one on top of the cliff) and the people. It is situated on an idyllic cliff overlooking the beach (you can go down to the beach directly) with stunning views up and down the coast. Dinner is served with 'all' (9) of the guests eating together on one table which creates interesting conversation - i suspect that there is always an eclectic crowd here. The owner is the expert on the local Theyyam ritual which is definitely worth getting up early in the morning to go and see. I cant really understand why anyone would come here other than as a base to see the Theyyam ceremony (and then only once and for one night only) but it seems that there is a loyal crowd that returns year after year. \Aint as queer as folk\"" as the saying goes. Main negative here is that we booked two rooms and when we turned up there was only one available so we had to add an extra bed to the double room. No disaster as it was a large room but mildly annoying. It is also located literally in the middle of nowhere so dont expect to find it without significant help from the owner on the telephone; asking locals; and getting one of the hotel staff to meet you half way and guide you there.""",via Web,Jan-14,with friends,3,3,3,2,3,4,DIL58,"London, United Kingdom",16,16,15,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r192022869-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

We were lucky enough to arrive while the local temple were performing their Theyyam ritual (see photographs) and it was truly incredible! Kurien is an expert in all aspects of the Theyyam so do ask him to explain the ritual to you.This was our first home stay in India and we were very impressed- the food was absolutely fantastic! We fell in love with Kerelite cuisine and as there are no restaurants in the area it really is the best and only way to stay! The best part of staying at a home stay is that you feel like you are part of the family and it is a great way to get to know the other guests. By the time we left we were all very close- it felt like a home away from home.The room was very nice and they even switched on our AC hours before we arrived so that the room was ready for us. I know this because I saw them do the same for another guest who arrived after us. So sweet.The beach is only a few minutes away by foot and is completely isolated and beautiful. There were a few men who stopped for a quick stare but in was very non threatening!Do watch for dolphins first thing in the morning. We were lucky enough to see a family of dolphins just past the break- there was even a little baby! The current is very strong so be very careful!I know we will be back next time we come to Kerala because I cant imagine how anywhere could be better! We were traveling on a shoestring budget so this was one of the more costly places we stayed but as all your meals are included it really is all you will spend while you are there so it is more than worth it!Thank you so much for everything Kurien! x,via Web,Mar-13,as a couple,5,5,5,5,5,5,Jojofair,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",7,6,6,5,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r159591004-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

In five minutes; its possible to reach the beach; which was quite secluded and a lovely place to watch the sunset.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Lovely guest house in to-die-for location”,5,02-01-2013,02/01/2013,Perched on a cliff-top above a small cove; this guest house is the stuff of dream getaway holidays. It is certainly not a luxurious experience. Rooms are large if basic; cooled by a sea-breeze and fans. Showers are best taken by the bucket method; and the power supply is occasionally spotty.Access to the beach is via a ladder-like stairway. The cove itself is quite small and the beach is sometimes inaccessible because of the high tide.Kurien's hospitality is legendary; and rightly so. He is a charming and helpful host who will help guests experience the fascinating Theyyam rituals held at small family temples at any hour of the night or early morning.

Most of the time the beach is deserted and the perfect place to peacefully enjoy some sun and sea. The Keralan food here is delicious! We especially enjoyed the lassis with lunch and the fresh fish served with dinner; there was a real variety of dishes and fresh fruit juice served with omelets on great brown bread for breakfast! The rooms are spotless with unique indian furnishings. You have a shady terrace to sit out on.

The building is on a small cove with a few other buildings. You get to the cove down some steps and we had it to ourselves most of the time for swimming and hanging out. You can walk round to longer beaches if you want. Kurian the manager organised a trip to a Theyyam ritual for us. It was to bless someone's house and was a fantastically powerful experience.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Lovely place and great food”,5,11/28/2012,11/28/2012,We stayed for a couple of nights (and I wish it had been more) at Costa Malabari; which is at a place called Thottada; a 20 minute auto ride from Kannur itself. It's a 5 minute walk from some beautiful; tropical beaches; and for two days we mostly had them pretty much to ourselves. The sea's warm and great for swimming in - we spent hours floating around and swimming up and down - and the golden beach is lined with palm trees; with red kites circling overhead.Costa Malabari itself is a smart; comfortable guest house; in a converted mill building; run by a friendly man with very good English. It's relatively basic but it was very peaceful; the bathroom was clean and spacious; and the food is really very good. They have a good selection of books and travel guides to read; and a nice veranda outside where you can while away an evening on the deck chairs; looking out onto trees. The manager will organise a trip to a nearby Theyyam ceremony in the evening if you want to go; as well as any transport to and from Kannur.The guest house wasn't the only building on the beach; as I'd imagined; but it's in a quiet little place with no shops or beach shacks at all - just some private houses and homestays scattered around behind the sands; and little sandy paths through the palm groves.

The small beach down the steep cliff is lovely; the jungle setting is beautiful; and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Make sure you know which building you're staying in; as there are 3. I believe #2 is the one on the cliff over the beach. One of the others is about a 5-10 minute walk through the jungle -- the only place where internet was actually working when I was there. The rooms are very basic; clean with fans and screens; but you probably won't want to spend much time inside. Rickshaw fare from the train station should be Rs 150 -- use prepaid or be prepared to bargain; since they will charge you twice as much. Also be sure they know which house to go to; especially if you haven't been there yet -- it can be hard to find any of the staff at certain times of day; and they tend to move around.,via Web,Oct-12,solo,4,4,4,3,4,4,carillonator,,2,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r145703399-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Not a thing you get used to....On the plus side were were taken to a local Theyyam (Hindu religious Festival) to see the spirits being ejected from a village by Kali and Shiva. The owner of the house is knowledgeable on Theyyams and always had time to talk to us.Kannur is a few Kms away by tuk tuk or taxi on rough roads and really isn't worth a visit so if you stay here you are isolated without transport.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Owner Has Checked Out//Major Construction Next Door”,2,1/29/2012,1/29/2012,We stayed here for three nights on the recommendation of a friend who had visited several years ago. Our main interest was attending a Theyyam which the owner arranged for us and which was fascinating. HOWEVER; Kurian; the owner has simply checked on this property...he has two others....and leaves a young kid (about 16 years old I would say) in charge. The kid is clearly overwhelmed. The food is adequate Keralan cuisine; nothing exceptional; and we stayed a total of two months in Kerala so we have a pretty good idea of how excellent Keralan cuisine can be. The place is not particularly clean or well maintained. A sign of the owner's indifference to this enterprise is the decrepit outdoor furniture that is straggled around the property and the absence of any hammocks along the property's stunningly beautiful frontage along a sea side cliff. In contrast; the owner's own property; where he lives; is beautifully maintained and charming. And has wireless which this property does not. Anybody considering a visit anytime anytime soon should also be aware that there is a MAJOR construction project going on immediately next door right next to the outdoor dining room. The noise was so great from the project site that we had to get up and eat on the other side of the property during one luncheon (they were pouring concrete on Sunday.)We were disappointed enough in this place to check out the competition and found a small hotel called the Waves Beach Resort; which is a five minute walk away. It was recently constructed; has the same spectacular view; and an energetic young owner anxious to please who speaks excellent English. Her energy and ambition contrast very favorably with the burned out; slothful indifference of Casa Malabari. The prices were about 20% less also.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Overrated - stay away”,2,1/29/2012,1/29/2012,This was our least favorite homestay during our nearly 3 week trip to Kerala; and I am mystified by all the positive reviews. The only thing that was positive about our stay was the magnificent view of the Arabian sea - that is why I did not give it 1 star. (Make sure if you do stay here - that this is the building you stay in).This homestay is clearly coasting on its laurels. The owner; who has 3 buildings in the area; was nowhere to be found for most of our stay; and left the day to day operations to a 17 year old boy who clearly needed more supervision. Meals were often served a half an hour after the designated time. Even something simple like getting a cup of coffee or tea would take 20 or more minutes (plus another 10 minutes to get non-sour milk).Most importantly; the place is not being maintained properly - water pressure was on and off (one night there was no water at all) and it was not clean. The beams in our room were patched up with ugly packing tape. The mosquito net our bed was provided with was full of holes; making it useless. To get wireless internet; you have to walk fifteen minutes through the woods to the owner's other property (though we didn't really care about that - other travelers might).Despite the wonderful view; the owner has not done any landscaping to speak of; and the back yard facing the ocean is basically a dirt lot with a few trees and several broken; filthy; uncomfortable beach chairs. Repairs are not being made - even minor ones like fixing unsightly broken wooden slats in the outdoor eating area. Our last day here was basically ruined by loud construction work taking place immediately next door (where a new home is being built). We were never offered any sort of discount or anything extra.The overall impression is that the owner just doesn't care about this place. And the sad thing is; with a little effort; this could be a truly wonderful homestay. Apparently; there is a new homestay down the road from Costa Malabari.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“not for kids”,3,10/20/2011,10/20/2011,we stayed here for a few nights with our 3 & 5 year olds. We had the place to ourselves as it was monsoon. It didn't rain all the time but when it did rain; this was not a problem. The problem was the stairs down to the beach. basically the house is on a cliff with the beach below and they have erected a metal staircase down from the cliff to the beach. But it is one of the scariest staircases I have ever used. There is a very serious drop onto rocks if you were to slip from the staircase and there is only a high hand rail. There are no barriers between the handrail and the stairs; so it is completely open. I would have a problem with this stair case even without children. It is a deathtrap waiting to happen. they only need to put bars in so that no one could fall through this huge gap and it would be ok. But they have not thought of safety here. That said the beach is very beautiful. the house and rooms are very basic and the garden is terrible and not cared for. The people who look after you at the house and do the cooking are lovely and the food is very good. As there was no one else staying we asked if our children could sleep in the room next to ours rather on the camp beds in our room and they let us do this and did not charge extra. There are 2 places in Kannur to choose from and if we went back we would stay at Kannur Beach House; which is right on the beach. Costa Malabari is in a very tranquil place and you are basically trapped here unless you pay; 150 for a rickshaw.

Costa Malabari Kannur,“Private and peaceful little sanctuary minutes from the beach”,5,8/30/2011,8/30/2011,Although I travelled to Costa Malabari during monsoon and it rained for almost 5 days straight; this private and peaceful guesthome truly gave my companion and I a very warm and welcoming experience. The staff is very kind and accomodating. Kurion; your main point person is phenomenal. He thoroughly explains the history of Theyyam (historical dance ritual) among many other things. He is a great resource and is well travelled throughout India and can help you with any questions you may have. Costa Malabari I can say with confidence provided the best food we have had in India. Kurion was more than willing to share various cooking secrets for traditional meals from Kerala. The facilties are simple; but very clean and all functioning. Except for the odd power outage due to the rains; the place really was a safe haven from the hustle and bustle of the city streets. It is nestled away in a wooded; coconut forest/grove close to the beach and is situated in a very picturesque part of Kannur.

This is 5 minutes walk from the coast; 20 minutes walk from paradise hidden beaches; either north or south. We were actually delighted to walk; having spent so many hours in trains or rickshaws over the last weeks... The surroundings are very residential at a very low density; hence we felt in the middle of nowhere and enjoyed taking all the meals in the house. It costs 1250 Rs per person inc. 3 meals and filtered water. In Costa Malabari indeed; this drinking water solution is the best option for the environment.There were 4 rooms and all 8 guests had meals together. A great opportunity to share traveller's stories. Food was excellent and in large quantities.The manager Kieran was very helpful. He organised a visit to a local temple where a small theyyam ritual was taking place. He also booked a room for us at a partner hotel (Pachyderm Palace) in Wayanad and explained everything for us to go by bus; the cheapest way!Also very useful is the Internet connexion; with a desktop computer that guests can use any time and for free.The only difficulty we had was with the advance booking. Tourist Desk Kochi was not really eager to answer emails and was very silly to request a transfer in Roupies from foreigners. We ignored that request and simply confirmed by email and on the phone a few days in advance.

The famous food was the same every day bar one; and again unlike every other homestay we visited was not particularly good. There is very little communal space to sit. The host was not nearly as informative as the local taxi drivers on theyyam and generally not very interested in his guests. There was no Christmas decorations or attempt to do something special for the guests who had flown out especially to celebrate there. It was expensive by Indian standards and was very much a property past its best.,via Web,NA,NA,1,1,NA,1,1,1,Margeritte,England,5,NA,4,9,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r12263129-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Costa Malabari Kannur,“Worth going for theyyam & food”,4,12-09-2007,12/09/2007,Like most visitors to Costa Malabari we were there for theyyam. The Manager; Mr Kurien; is very happy to share his knowledge & arrange for you to visit a theyyam in the season; and is a welcoming host. It was defintely worth visiting for this alone.Mr Kurien is also very happy to help organise onward travel/flights/rooms; etc. I think he is part-owner of a travel agency.The rooms are simple; but clean on arrival; although no-one cleaned our room during our stay & this was the only place we stayed on our trip where sheets were not changed every day. Light in the room was good enough to read at night. Like others; we also encountered creepy crawlies in the bathroom; but not to an excessive level.The food is very good - proper Keralan home cooking. No choice as such but with so many dishes served at each meal it would be easy to miss out one you didn't like. Bananas and purified water were available freely at any time.There were a few things that we didn't like about Costa Malabari1. Europeans predominate. During our stay everyone was European and if you spent an extended time here it could feel like you were hidden away somewhere in Europe. This was the only place we stayed on our trip where we were not chatting to Indian visitors as well.2. Lack of outside space. There is a big airy communal hall with a dining table to sit at; where people tended to congregate & chat. The latest Lonely Planet says 'lots of comfy lounging areas dot the outside'; but this is complete nonsense. There is virtually no outside space to 'dot'; so everyone is sat on the porch; which has comfortable chairs but is packed in tight so that it feels as if you are on top of one another. 3. Lack of privacy; depending on which rooms you have. The two rooms at the front have windows facing onto the porch where everyone sits outside. If you are in one of these; by 6am there is likely to be someone sat about 2 feet from your bed having what sounds at that time of the morning and proximity like an extremely loud conversation ..... and able to hear every sound you make as well!There is now another Costa Malabari house; perched on a clifftop a few minutes away; with steps down to a beach. We took a quick look and standards appeared to be the same. Here there was no big communal interior; but definitely a bit more space outside.,via Web,Nov-07,as a couple,3,3,NA,4,4,5,TimeToTravelAgain,UK,77,59,51,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r11354674-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Costa Malabari Kannur,“Incredible Food”,4,05-06-2007,05/06/2007,My party of 8 recently stayed at the property and I can't tell you enough about the wonderful service offered by the people at Costa Malabari. While the rooms were quite basic in nature and played host to everything from scorpions to flying cockroaches; what the rooms lacked in character was more than made up for by the incredible service and food from Mr. Kurrien and his staff. The beach is only about a four minute walk away. The style of the beach house is typical Keralan style with open high beams that encourage constant airflow. I was a bit concerned with not having air conditioning but I needn't have been. We were able to rest comfortably thanks to the fans and open windows. I can't say enough about the food and the huge portions we received. We had everything from fried Baracuda to mussels and chicken biryani. I would recommend this property for anyone looking for a bit of an off the beaten path adventure. It's definitely not a luxury property but is well worth a stay.,via Web,May-07,with friends,4,3,NA,2,4,5,travelhappy1,Alabama,14,12,9,3,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r7550244-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Costa Malabari Kannur,“Fantastic”,5,05-03-2007,05/03/2007,After being recommended to visit Costa Malabari by someone who had stayed there for three months we felt his opinions of great food and a homely atmosphere may have been somewhat biased but after visiting for ourselves we realized everything he said was correct. As explained in the previous review the accomodation is spacious and very clean; arranged around a congenial dining hall- which is a great place to sit if you feel like a chat. Although at the top of our budget at Rs2000 a night it is full board and the food really is fantastic. We found it quite hard to sample real Keralan food in restaurants around the state so to experience such high quality home cooking- all served up on a banana leaf was quite special. In terms of local attractions it seems to main reason visitors come to Cannanore is to search out a Theyyam. The owner has a wealth of knowledge on these spectacular rituals which he is more than willing to share with you around the table at supper and if you stay for a few nights you may even be able to see a few. They reach their peak in the early hours of the morning - but a taxi is usually arranged between a group of guests for the journey. As well as visiting the Theyyam's the area is also a fantastic place to explore on foot. It is quite easy to get lost in the coconut groves but with incredibly friendly and hospitable locals this rarely causes too much of a problem. If; of course; you don't feel like doing anything there are 3 deserted beaches 5 minutes from the guest house to swim or sunbathe. Getting to the guest house from Kannur station can be a problem as not all taxi and richshaw drivers know the place. However making a phone booking before can solve this as the owner will happily send a taxi to pick you up. All in all; a real highlight in our trip around India; and even if you are on a really tight budget I would recommend splashing out on this place!,via Web,May-07,as a couple,5,4,NA,5,5,5,GulabJammun,Berkshire,20,10,13,1,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g777115-d307180-r7542224-Costa_Malabari-Kannur_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Costa Malabari Kannur,“A great place on the Malabar Coast; northern Kerala”,5,03-01-2007,03/01/2007,Costa Malabari; Near Adikadalayi Temple; Kannur; Wayanad District; 670 007 Kerala; IndiaThis marvelous guesthouse in northern Kerala is located on a narrow dirt road a few kilometers from the nearest city; itself an enjoyable place to wander around and easily accessible by bus from the nearby temple. Mr. Kurian; the owner; is the best source for performances of theyyam; an ancient spirit-possession rite that is rife in this area in hundreds of variants. He knows where performances will be taking place and arranges transportation. The other point of interest is the beautiful and nearly deserted beach; a five-minute walk from the guesthouse. Walking on the nearby roads is enjoyable; you might see a mongoose or some curious birds; not to mention friendly local residents. Accommodations--now expanded into nearby cottages as well as the four or five rooms in the main house; each with its own bathroom--are clean and comfortable; the food is topnotch and copious; and the other guests--from various European countries and the U.S. when we were there--are themselves full of interest; with old-timers more than willing to share their knowledge of the locality. Everyone eats together around a long table; and chairs on the porch invite further conversation or quiet reading. We were glad that we had a cell phone with us when our driver; hired to drive our party of four from Kalpetta; was stumped after we got to the area. Mr. Kurian himself met us at the top of the road for reassurance.

Hotel Maya International Srimangala,“Miserable service”,1,12-02-2013,12/02/2013,I stayed here for two days on a business trip. The rooms are quite big & cleanliness is maintained. But beyond this; I have faced a lot of problems. - The rooms facing the road are well-lit & ventilated; but very noisy. The a/c does not cool the room properly. The mattress & linen is worn-out and needs replacement. - Food options for vegetarians are very limited (cannot comment on non-veg preparations). Request for non-oily & non-spicy food did not have much effect. - One cannot get even a cup of tea before 7am as restaurant/room service starts at 7am! Similarly evening service starts at 7pm.- Breakfast is complementary; but has a fixed plate menu of south-indian preparations only. The breakfast is supposed to start at 7am. However; I had an early checkout on last day; but it was not ready at 7.15am.- To top it all; on my checkout; I noticed a discrepancy in my main bill & supportings for room service. But the receptionist insisted that the bill was correct & I have to pay-up. After an argument for 15 min the hotel manager was called; and it was found out that the receptionist had not attached all supportings with the bill; as some were still lying in the bill-folder!!,via Web,Nov-13,on business,2,3,2,3,4,1,Rakesh S,"Mumbai, India",33,31,24,1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297630-d3444133-r186492292-Hotel_Maya_International-Mangalore_Karnataka.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

The staff was very friendly; the morning breakfast was very good except for the Upma. The Medu wadas and Dosas though were excellent.They do have a very weird position for the TVs in the room though; they are placed very low on the wall under the windows.Also the rooms seemed to have excessive curtains; as it has tints on it's windows; plus some 3 layers of curtains and they did not open. SO needed the lights on even during the day.Also the kitchen only had a fridge; no gas stove or microwave which would have been handy since they do not have room service or any snacks etc available after 11pm.Also the discotheque in the floor below is open even during the day and in the night; so the living room tends to feel the vibrations but the rooms are peaceful.Over all; it was a good palce to stay; and as we were there for a wedding; it became a nice party pad for all of us due to the huge living room .,via Web,Nov-12,with family,4,5,5,4,4,3,BombaySymphony,Bombay,55,21,23,3,2,Room Tip: If you are a group of 6 or more; it definitely makes sense to book the penthouse.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297630-d3444133-r147130415-Hotel_Maya_International-Mangalore_Karnataka.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Hotel Naveen Regency Chitradurga,“Decent breakfast; dirty ambience and uninterested service”,2,9/17/2014,9/17/2014,This place is on the Bengaluru-Mumbai highway and I have stopped here a few times for breakfast and lunch whilst enroute. Honestly; the food is ok. They do not serve a variety of dishes for breakfast but only idli; vadas and dosas (the in house guests are served the same buffet style which you can also opt for; for a per head fee). For lunch I'd recommend the South Indian thali. But it is the dirty tables that makes me cringe. Leftover food bits from previous meal or the people who have used the table before you is a common sight. A request to clean the table means that the waiter will make a face and sweep half of the crumbs on the floor and ignore you when you request for the rest of the table to be cleaned. I guess that as they are assured of patrons; thanks to their convenient location of being situated right on the highway; they do not care about the service they provide. Also; they push you into buying mineral water here by not serving regular filtered water. Upon asking to be served filtered water they behave as if they've not heard you but a request for bottled water is serviced within minutes. But; they have a clean loo that you can use. And that is A BIG attraction while travelling. I am sure that if another restaurant came up on the highway with better service; food and a LOO Naveen will lose clients in a jiffy.,via Web,Sep-14,with family,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ShilpaNayakBelagajee,"Mumbai, India",50,29,23,4,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1676032-d1811790-r229397250-Hotel_Naveen_Regency-Chitradurga_Karnataka.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Shreenath Palace is a 400 hundred yaers old haveli located close to the Dushera Chowk(Palace) ;next to the Jain Temples with total 5 rooms. It is itself a sightseeing spot for folks going towards the Temples.We were picked up from a Railway Station at 5:30 AM in the morning and ushered quickly to our room to ensure we had some sleep before the day start for sightseeing.Though we had booked the Maharani room ;we were upgraded to the Mughal room upon arrival; considering we were the only one staying.We were amazed at the beauty and the old world charm of the room; neat and clean;stained glass windows; curtains and drapes;vintage furniture and everything giving you a Royal feel. It was a dream come true to stay in a 400 years old haveli inhabited by the Royals once.Bathroom was clean to every inch with hot water readily available; weather was cold and a hot water bath was a great respite from an almost 24 hours travel fatigue.Bed was nice with Spring mattress and ample of pillows and cushions to support.Breakfast was too good; Rajasthani delicacies paired with continental stuff. Great varierty and awesome taste.It was our marriage anniversary the next day and we had planned for a Desert Safari and stay overnight in the camps.Om uncle got us a nice deal and ensured we were treated at par and ensured we felt special on the day.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Below Average Hotel”,2,11-01-2013,11/01/2013,we decided this hotel after seeing good review from net but got utterly disappointed after visiting this hotel. It is a private place with some rooms converted into a heritage type hotel and room allotted to us is found to be stuffy and not spacious and bathroom diappointing. The hotel is in the jaisalmer fort itself with the 2nd largest bldg after the palace and terrace view is good. Though breakfast is included but there is no provision of lunch or dinner and has to arranged from outside. Frequent low voltage problem observed with lights getting dimmed and AC not working. The only positive side is the owner and staffs being very courteous and helpful.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Never missed home!!!”,5,10/25/2013,10/25/2013,Last week; we ie. me; my wife; my 5-yr old son and an attendant had visited jaisalmer. A close friend of mine had asked us to stay in this particular hotel. So without any further enquiries; my wife made a reservation for two nights with Giraj (hotel owner) over phone. Right from day one of her telephonic conversation with Giraj; he was extremely cooperative and helpful.On the day we reached Jaisalmer; we were picked up by an auto rickshaw from the station (as cars are not allowed inside the Fort where the hotel is located). As soon as we reached the hotel; Giraj's father (Uncle) was there to greet us. And what a man he is!! He is so full of life. A real joy to be with and very well respected by everyone in the fort. And so is Giraj. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The entire family used to be there for our every whim and fancies.We stayed in two different rooms - and both the rooms are very tastefully done and have split air-conditioners. Though none of the rooms have televisions; we never felt its absence as we would all be chit-chatting late into the night with the entire family. They did not even charge us for the nimbu-paani; tea and snacks which we had everyday inspite of us offering to pay. Their large-hearted hospitality was the reason that we extended our stay there by one day. Special mention to the hotel staff Mr Hindu. Always smiling and ready to serve. In short; henceforth we cant even think of staying anywhere other then this Haveli.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Shreenath Palace: A Royal Experience”,5,6/23/2013,6/23/2013,At the corner of an eventful lane in Jaisalmer; stands a proud historic structure called the Shreenath Palace. It is a beautiful ancient palace that is now run as a palace hotel for the tourists who visit the city of Jaisalmer. I visited Jaisalmer with my family in the month of December. It was extremely crowded being a peak tourist season. The Shreenath Palace is astoundingly peaceful and a quiet luxurious get away from the bustling events of the day in the city. There are only 5 rooms in the entire Palace; which makes this place all the more exclusive! The sooner your book them the better it is; its a limited edition/luxury hotel.The interiors and architecture have been retained as they were which really enhanced the authenticity of the place; it takes you back in time. Ofcourse; there are some minimum necessary changes to make your stay more convenient and comfortable. The Rooms and restrooms are splendid; clean and well maintained; without any problem in the support services. The narrow; circular stairway and really high steps are an excellent workout to get to your room! Walking into the room; I was amazed at the ambience; as I had only read about such high ceilings; lavish bed spreads and elaborate architecture in my history textbooks; however thanks to Shreenath Palace; I was living my dream. The walls; steps; windows have not been changed wee bit; and that is what makes this place so special. The ancient large windows and galleries provide you with a beautiful view of the small city; it is indeed a treasured experience to sit there and enjoy the quiet and the winds. Considering the hectic lifestyles that each one of us have; this place really calms you down and allows you to spend quality time with yourself and your family; moreover you can really connect and be in sync with yourself here. Winter vacations to this place are highly recommended. It has an amazing terrace with a view of the city that will amaze you; totally worth it! There is no television; telephone or wifi in your rooms; you may receive those services by contacting the staff. To order your tea or breakfast; you have to open the window of your room; stick your head out and shout out to Mr. Hindu; the support staff; to tell him what you want. This is a once in a lifetime experience! You will live like the people lived in history! Go ahead and pamper yourself :) Hot tea with warm buttered toast in the cold mornings brought to your room; are simply wow! Couple of minutes from Shreenath Palace is a rooftop restaurant called Sagar; which has mouth watering Indian cuisine; with a really welcoming service staff. This place is a must; especially in the cold! All the important historic monuments are within walking range from Shreenath Palace; adjoining is the market for interested shoppers. The owner; Mr. Raj Vyas; is an incredibly warm host supported by the efficient room and other services of his employee Mr. Hindu. Also; feel free to ask Mr. Raj about the variety of events and places that you could explore during your stay. Apart from being a wonderful place to stay; it is also an important historic structure; one of the spots you would halt at with your tourist guide; as it belonged to the financial advisor of the king at a time in the history of Jaisalmer; who are the ancestors of the owner; Mr. Raj. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable and luxurious experience! Don't forget to sit by the window/gallery and enjoy!

Rakesh told us that Shreenath was our home while we were there and it really did feel like it! We stayed in the opulent Maharajah suite and in the morning when we were ready for breakfast we opened our window and shouted down to Hindu who brought it to our room. We enjoyed beautiful sunsets from the rooftop and also a sunrise on our last day when Hindu served us breakfast on the roof. Raj also gave me beautiful sumptuous sari fabric for a gift before we left. The family are among the warmest and most hospitable that we have ever had the pleasure to meet. And what a hotel! It is an ornate sandstone haveli in the middle of the fort; intricately carved; a real work of art; as lovely as any tourist attraction in the town.

For starters Jaisalmer is unique in that people have lived continuously inside the fort for many hundreds of years. Staying here; you become one of them. If you prefer Hiltons and Hyatts; this is probably not for you.Since cars are not allowed inside the fort; to get to the hotel you'll need to transfer to a tuk tuk (3 wheel motorcycle taxi) or else walk through the narrow lanes.The property has been in the same family for generations and in reality; this is more of a guest house than a hotel. The rooms are historic and though simply furnished; are comfortable; though everything (pillows included) are old. There is no elevator and it is a bit of a hike up the stone stairs.The best part of the stay was the people - the owner; his son; and their \boy\"". They genuinely cared for our well being and did all they could to make us comfortable. For instance; my sons and I went up to the roof to watch the sunset and they came up after us with a blanket and water. Also; when we arrived; they pulled out a selection of scarves for us to choose as gifts.We were here in the midst of summer; when it is incredibly hot. Although our rooms had a/c units; they really couldn't chill enough and we didn't get much sleep the first night. Also; like many parts of India; regular power outages are the norm and this place does not have a backup generator; so when the power goes out; only the fans keep going. When my wife was upset the next morning and chose not to have breakfast; we later learned that the owner refused his own breakfast in sympathy. When we returned; he did everything he could to cheer her up. When they found out the problem; they brought in swamp coolers to help bring the temperature down.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“not the best hotel but...”,4,6/16/2012,6/16/2012,We were collected by car at Jodhpur airport by an AC car and arrived at the Palace 5hrs later.Be warned; despite the distance and how long you think it should take if you were driving; it takes twice as long because of the road quality; cows and the fact that the owner of the Palace tells the driver to drive us foreigners slowly no doubt due to scare stories you can read on here from some people about high speed near misses and head-on collisions. So...slow but safe is nice if not a tad frustrating.We were met by Hindu; the hotel helper who carried our luggage from the main square within the fort to the short walk to the hotel.The hotel itself is in a 450yr old 4 storey haveli. As with all authentic palaces like this; its a little rough around the edges but full of charm and delight.We had a welcome cup of tea with the owner who excitedly told us about all the famous and important guests he'd had and checked with us what our plans were for the next few days. We met his wife and his other helper and were immediately made to feel we were staying in his house rather than a hotel.The rooms upon initial entry were 'wow' with stunning carved stone walls and porticos with majestic beds and carpets and curtains. Closer inspection and its a little more shabby chic but the views from your own little balcony of the Jain Temples make up for it.On the downside; the bed is rock hard and for someone in their 40's as opposed to a backpacker in their 20's; I'd have preferred more comfort. The bathroom with shower is basic but works and there is nowhere to hang clothes but we are in Jasailmer and this has retained its original charm as opposed to being sanitised by a Hilton or Ian Schrager. You could wipe it clean and wipe out its character to produce a perfect boutique hotel but that's not the point.The best part of this place is the owner and the staff. Hindu was a delight to chat to over breakfast on the roof terrace with his tales of life in his home village and ans for his life. The owner was a complete charmer. A real friendly uncle who you wanted to hug. He personally took us out to the desert for camel riding because he liked to personally check the quality of the camels. He was always telling us not to buy anything without asking him first because he could get us a better deal with the same person and the cynic new arrival from London in me didn't believe it was anything more than a typical ruse to get me to buy from his friend instead; but I was wrong and he really does know everyone and really could get you a better deal on everything. We were late back from the desert so missed the Jaisalmer Palace opening times but he knew the Commissioner and offered to open the Palace up for us specially to have a night time view.So: loved Jasailmer; loved the fort; the desert and the amazingly friendly shopkeepers and tuk-tuk drivers everywhere in the town; loved the haveli but really loved the owner so it didn't matter if I liked; loathed or loved the room.,via Web,Mar-12,as a couple,4,5,2,3,3,4,MrJ,"London, UK",97,47,48,1,1,Room Tip: make sure you ask if any room has AC and if it does (not just a fan) choose it!,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r132102860-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

The Jain temples were almost within touching distance of our bedroom window. The Palace a 2 minute walk away. Our room was large; clean and comfortable; the mattresses are hard but I actually prefer a hard mattress. It is an old building (450 years old) the stairs in the hotel are narrow and steep; would not be suitable for people with mobility problems. Be careful with the door frames as they are really low; my poor husband hit his head so many times...Hindoo the person for everything; was really very helpful; always smiling and could not do enough for us.There is no restaurant in the hotel; this for us was not a problem as there are enough places to eat within walking distances.As another reviewer pointed out; the rooms are a little dusty; there is no glass in the windows; just shutters; all these small things did not matter for us; staying in this wonderful bit of history was what mattered.I would definitely recommend this place.,via Web,Feb-12,as a couple,4,4,4,4,4,4,Sharonlinda01,"Frankfurt, Germany",14,13,11,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r126382215-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Lovely Building & Even Nicer People”,5,3/18/2012,3/18/2012,My wife and I stayed for 7 nights as part of a month-long trip around northern Rajasthan in celebration of our 40th wedding anniversary.The haveli is close to the major sights within the fort - the Jain temples were almost within touching distance of our bedroom window while the Palace was a 2 minute stroll away. As is frequently the case with such an old building; the stairs are steep but the ambience is well worth the physical exertion - if you want characterless comfort pick an antiseptic alternative provided by one of the global chains.The real stars of the haveli; however; are the people. Hindoo; the general factotum; was always on hand to help and (on demand/free of charge) made the best masala chai that we have ever tasted throughout our many trips to India. Raj; the owner's son; was ever helpful and smiling. As for the owner; Rakesh; l struggle to find words to describe his friendliness and generosity - from the arrangements he made to celebrate our anniversary; through his booking of a sunset camel ride on the dunes at Khuri (including snacks and drink that he provided) and his obtaining a luxury car to ferry us beyond Jodhpur. In each case; his actions went well beyond any reasonable expectation.Referring to some of the comments contained within other reviews - yes; the mattresses are hard (but this is India); yes; the room was slightly dusty - a reflection of the fact that the windows have no glass but loose fitting shutters and the town is in the middle of a desert; and yes there were no chairs but rather cushions and mats on which to sit/lie.In conclusion; a lovely; atmospheric building with great people - I would suggest that only the inflexible of mind and body should reject the haveli as a possible haven of rest.,via Web,Jan-12,as a couple,5,5,5,4,4,5,Tabascoleathergrain,"St Helens, England",102,38,38,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r126287476-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“The best memories of India”,5,01-10-2012,01/10/2012,Reading the previous reviews I kept thinking: what’s the point of visiting India; if tourists don’t give a chance to themselves to be a part of India; to enter in the deep ethos of India and its people; their routines; their flavors; their colors; smells; religion; respects; culture after all. In Rome; be a roman.When we went to Shreenath Palace Hotel we felt we were home; at our Indian home. Every single detail was a kind; tender and touching gift from a family who run a business; like a family carefully run its own house. It’s not about the staff; which actually is absolutely helpful and careful; it is about the way you relate with this family. And our experience gave us the best memories of India. Everything was as expected. They arrange us massages in our room; desert experiences; city tours; great rickshaw drivers; shopping tips; the best flavors in town; even clothes (we have lost a backpack in the airplane company; and they help us to got it back); internet; rooftop view chai; friendship; unforgettable memories.Our room was a comfortable; clean; pleasant and a traditional Indian room from an ancient haveli; which; in fact; the hotel is.Our location; the best in town; was just in the center of the fort; two steps away from the temples; the palace and the doors of the fort.Beyond doubt we sincerely recommend this hotel.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Quite bizarre”,3,11/13/2011,11/13/2011,Spent two nights here on a Rajasthan tour with my wife and daughter.We went to Jaisalmer expecting a rough and ready frontier town; but it is in fact just a tourist trap with no other reason for its existence. Full of tat shops and italian restaurants. The old fort is pretty much spoiled by all this; and doesn't really bear comparison with Mehrangarh in Jodhpur.This hotel; I guess like many others; makes much of the fact that it is inside the fort; and this certainly adds to its charm - although I don't believe this should be an excuse for the lack of facilities generally available. I think they just want to keep up with the 'out there' backpacker expectations (not that they'll get any at the prices they charge).Shreenath palace is an old haveli; and the rooms are fantastically decorated; all carved sandstone; archways and balconies. The furnishings however were inadequate; with only a bed; no table or chairs; and the bathroom while reasonably clean was in poor condition.The young chap; Hindoo; who did all the running around for the owner did a good job of breakfast; and arranged rickshaws to and from where our driver had to drop us off outside the fort.If we found reason to go to Jaisalmer again (can't think of one at the moment); we might stay again - but only for the sake of amusement rather than luxury!,via Web,Oct-11,with family,2,4,3,3,2,4,UK_Expat_100,Bangalore,7,7,7,7,2,Room Tip: The stairs are very steep; but are round such tight corners you couldn't fall very far.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r120534267-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Not just visiting a historic monument - sleeping in one!”,4,11-12-2011,11/12/2011,There is apparently a lot of debate (controversy) about staying in the fort; so much so that Lonely Planet doesn't review hotels and restaurants there. I don't agree with this - these people have to make a living as well - so we booked a room here without regret. We didn't regret our decision afterward either. The hotel is quaint and historic. The kids loved it from the first moment - they said it was like being in an Indiana Jones movie. Plus; the doors were their size. Adults have to be very careful of this; especially the first night trying to get to the bathroom. The owners (a father and son team) were very hospitable; and the location was perfect. The only criticism I can think of was that there were small details that somewhat spoiled the experience - liked exposed wires hanging from the ceiling and things like that. I understand that it is hard to make a hotel out of a 450-year-old building; but the experience would be much better for travellers if they tried a little harder to cover some of these things up.,via Web,Mar-11,with family,5,5,5,4,4,5,JeffinPrague,"Prague, Czech Republic",72,27,37,7,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r120485527-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

I was sick upon arrive and the whole staff was helpful and caring-even fetching hydration salts; biscuits; and water for me. The one staff issue we did have was that the young man on staff stares at the female guests. At one point; we sat waiting for our friend to finish checking her email and he sat and stared at us for a good 20 minutes. It was awkward to say the least. Hopefully some feedback to the owner will help this issue. The rooms are beautiful but need to be kept cleaner since the hotel is in the dusty; dirty fort. Beds were very hard and we didn't have hot water for the two nights we stayed. My room stayed comfortable but my friends' room with a vaulted ceiling got quite hot. They were also a little unnerved by the fact that the staff room on the floor above them opened up into their room. With the problem with the staff staring at us; we weren't sure if there was any \peeking\"" going on or not. Overall; the owner is a good guy who has a beautiful home he has opened up to travelers.

Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“We loved it”,5,4/25/2010,4/25/2010,Where to start? The room was royal; with spacious comfortable beds (I have a bad back; so a hard mattress is heaven for me; when I find a soft one I have to put it on the floor to survive the night) and part of it was made into a marble bathroom. The bathroom was a bit chilly in the mornings because it has no glass windowpanes; but it was enough to make sure you had your shower in the afternoon; when it was sunny. There were pigeons on the arched windows; and you had a choice of a number of wonderful views. Such peace and beauty that cannot be conveyed. The owners were; as also written by other people; really kind and polite; they were helpful only when needed and didn't intrude in the least when not needed; always ready to share useful tips (on how much things should cost outside; for instance). They never ever pressured us to buy a camel tour or anything from them. When my daughter and I were sick because of flies on the food in a restaurant; the owner came up with fruit and biscuits; knowing we hadn't been out for a couple of days and probably were hungry. I mean; such a sweetie!And the price was incredible value. I would definitely go back there. Maybe there are other havelis as beautiful as this one; so one is tempted to go and experience another one next time; but I would surely consider going back to the same one; just because I know these people; and this makes a difference.,via Web,Jan-07,with family,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,irmar,Athens,15,6,8,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r62355334-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

We (whether it be right or wrong) fell in love with Hotel Shreenath Palace; and stayed for 2 nights in November 2009 (Maharaja Room). Built in the 15th century; descendants of the original family still live here today! The owner is a delightful man and very willing to share with you his wealth of knowledge of the local area. The haveli is intimate (5 guest rooms); features many intricate carvings and is a treasure trove of gorgeous archways; delicate alcoves; varying sized balconies and winding staircases. Our room overlooked the nearby Jain Temples.Despite the plethora of shops selling camel safaris and Rajasthani handcrafts; it's hard not to be enchanted with Jaisalmer. The imposing Fort rises magically like a multi-turreted sand castle. It is a spectacular sight during the day; but when floodlit at night; it take on a whole new appeal. Jaisal Italy offers brilliant views from their rooftop restaurant; and they serve excellent pizzas too! An intricate web of narrow streets meander their way through the insides of the Fort. The sacred cow wanders freely. Take care as you approach corners; you may run into a set of horns or there may be a fresh cow pad waiting for you to step in! Make sure you visit the Old City; in particular; several of the lavish sandstone havelis. We visited Khuri Sand Dunes (approximately 40km southeast of Jaisalmer) for a sunset camel safari. Do your homework regarding \""fair and reasonable price\"" before you arrive! There are plenty of operators willing to overcharge!! We had a very pleasant experience though you are not alone. The night we visited; there were possibly 30-50 other tourists also experiencing the dunes. We travelled alone (not as one big group) but you can still see and hear the other people on the dunes. From the research I did; Khuri is much less touristy than Sam Sand Dunes (also 40km from Jaisalmer but different direction); so you can expect even a less personal experience there. Khuri is a small village where many of the locals live in mud huts with straw thatched roofs.""",via Web,Nov-09,as a couple,5,5,5,5,4,5,Gypsy1967,"Melbourne, Australia",21,18,19,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r61176988-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Many an evening was spent on the roof watching the sun set over the nearby temples. Set in the middle of the fort; overlooking the surrounding desert - my experience here was superb and I will definitely return on my next visit to India. We were made to feel very welcome and part of the family. Nothing was too much trouble; from collecting us from our train; organising the camel safari (I highly recommend staying in the desert overnight); helping to book future hotels and transport. We planned on staying only 2-3 nights but found it impossible to tear ourselves away and stayed for 5 plus the safari!! We stayed at two other hotels in India and were disappointed both times due to our amazing time at Shreenath. I honestly cannot recommend it enough!! I suggest early booking as I know I am not the only person to think this!! Hindu's Masala Chai is unbeatable!! I can't thank them enough for making my first experience of India so memorable!,via Web,Dec-08,with friends,5,5,NA,5,5,5,SandyR69,London,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r23310260-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Fantastic Rooms”,4,10-11-2008,10/11/2008,We were impressed by the pics we had seen of this hotel and the reality does not let you down ! Our host Raj was helpful and hospitable from the word go. He fetched us from the entrance of the fort; showed us our rooms and even had hot steaming cups of flavored tea sent up.His uncle who stays on the property as caretaker takes his role seriously. To say he took care of us is an understatement! Just a bit of reality check before yo book this property. It is beautiful and breathtaking; but owing to the fact that it is located right IN the fort- it involves a little bit of walking. Families with young ones need to be extra careful as the balconies can be a problem.Older travellers may also consider giving it a second thought since the stairways are both narrow and steep. But if you are fit and fancy a taste of an authentic haveli; head here.,via Web,Oct-08,with family,4,3,NA,4,3,4,Klara_8,Bangalore,12,10,10,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r20794044-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“One of the very best stays in India”,5,5/22/2008,5/22/2008,Third time in Rajastan; first in Jaisalmer...we found Shreenath Palace on the web and we absolutely recommend it. From the very first e-mail contact the manager; Raj; has been extremely efficient and quick in answering. At the end we relied on him also for the car transfer in the whole state: the driver picked us up in Jodhpur; dropped us in Bikaner and a few days later brought us to Jaisalmer. Everything went absolutely smoothly; but the best was yet to come. The hotel is very small but very special. Each of the five rooms is a marvel carved in stone; it's like living in museum; with the difference that it is your room. It is also very clean; and located just in the center of the fort; which means you can enjoy the hectic market streets in the day; packed of tourists and shops ; and the peaceful strolling in the incredible surroundings in the evening. There are quite a number of heritage properties around the state; and we visited many of them over the past years; but this has the added value of its familiar dimension; and Raj and his family are delicious guests; who really make you feel a warm hospitality. They will not feed you with continuous shopping suggestions nor push you for a camel safari; but if you ask for anything their advice will be precise and reliable. My own advice is: consider spending in Shreenath Palace a few more than the two-three days strictly necessary to all the major attractions and landscapes of the city. Where the general tendency is to make a tourist out of you; this hotel is an island where you can feel yourself a traveler and a guest.,via Web,Mar-08,as a couple,5,5,NA,5,5,5,alysso,Trieste,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r16308493-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Beautiful room; great experience”,5,4/27/2008,4/27/2008,Booked through Hostelbookers; as it looked really interesting and had the highest rating. Thought we had arranged a pick up from the station; but in the end made our own way there. It costs about rs.20 tourist tax each to get out of the station! then another rs.20 to go to the gate of the fort. They then make you take another rickshaw up into the fort for more money; but we got them down to rs.30 for that journey up the hill.Arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the beautiful Raj; who runs the bookings and checkins. We were then joined by Omjee; his father and owner; who was very interested to meet us; particularly when we mentioned we used Tripadvisor!! The house has been in their family for years; but they now live over the street. There is a room downstairs where Omjee stays; and where we would sit and chat with him. He even offered to let us watch the TV when my husband mentioned the football.When we arrived they took us up to our room; gave us a menu and arranged for the restaurant next door to cook us thali; then brought it up to our room. A nice touch; after travelling for hours on the train to get there. We didn't settle the bill for that until the day we left! The room was beautiful - the Maharaja suite - a large room with double bed; mattress and cushions on the floor around a small table; large windows looking out onto the Jain temple; a fan and a large water cooled fan; and a good sized clean bathroom with hot shower. We loved the room. Because its so hot there; you need to keep the windows open for a draft; but they gave us insect repellent plug-ins and offered us a mosquito net if we needed it.Omjee was also a teacher at the local school; and asked us to come and see it one morning; as we are teachers too. His son brought us breakfast that morning to our room; tea and toast; to help us get up! He was very helpful giving us tips on the places to buy things; what prices we should be paying; where to go; etc. He was very generous to us; and even helped us out bargaining with the local shopkeeper for a tshirt and cushion cover.Omjee was very interested in technology; particularly our Ipods. He was willing to buy them off us; and we eventually gave him our broken speakers; which seemed to make his day. We had a great time at this hotel; made more interesting because they were easy to talk to and very helpful. It was the best place we stayed while travelling around Rajasthan. I think its worth paying for the larger rooms on the top floor. The restaurant next door has good food; and we spent our last afternoon there; sat on mattresses under their fans; waiting for our next train. Omjee then paid for our taxi back to the station. If you fancy a beer you can get them at the restaurant for rs.90 and sit on their rooftop to watch the sunset. And its definitely better to stay in the fort; particularly as its empty of all the tour groups in the evenings; and people not hassling you.,via Web,Apr-08,as a couple,5,5,NA,4,4,5,jclewis,"Bristol, United Kingdom",48,46,40,9,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r15403736-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Not a Review but an experience that left a bad taste”,3,04-11-2008,04/11/2008,This is probably the most peculiar review as we never actually stayed at the Shreenath Palace. My initial experience booking the place was fine. Unfortunately; when my husband; daughter and I got to Jodhpur 2 days before leaving for Jaisalmer (a remote border town); our daughter had become so sick and dehydrated that there was a good chance she may need hospitalisation. After agonising in Jodhpur for a day; and seeing no particular improvement in her condition; we called a decision on Jaisalmer and decided it was wiser to cancel...we felt we should return to South India and her regular pediatrician's care. We called the Shreenath Palace immediately to cancel (with many apologies and explanations) and was treated to a furious diatribe by the owner/manager. I knew that he would probably fill our room at a moment's notice as it was high season; but still offered to send him compensation for our short notice; which he angrily refused.It was really disheartening and somewhat scary (with some details which I feel disinclined to share in a public space). It was the first time in our 20 adult years of travelling over the world we had ever cancelled plans in an emergency; and this added to the disturbing experience. I thought I should share it.,via Web,Dec-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,IndUsa,"New York, NY and India",27,12,16,2,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r14959276-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Fantastic experience”,4,04-06-2008,04/06/2008,We had the Maharaja room for three nights and it was a delightful experience. The owner is very conversable and of great help. Our room was almost an other-wordly experience; like staying in another century. from our room we looked right at the nearby Jain temples. You must be prepared for a hot stay though; because there is no A/C and the top floor gets quite hot. People in the fort live side by side; so it's not quiet either. We also thought that the room could have been cleaner. All in all highly recommandable. Since the owner does not serve breakfast we also recommend the Sagar Restaurant next to the guesthouse which serves fantastic vegetarian dishes and has the nicest cook we ever met.,via Web,Mar-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ourmaninberlin,Berlin,6,6,6,2,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r14826402-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Wonderful hosts and Real Heritage Hotel”,4,3/30/2008,3/30/2008,"Our first impression on arrival in Sreenath Palace early morning at 0600hrs was not very encouraging. We had confirmed with the host pick up from Rly station and were thoroughly disappointed that we were left to find out the way to the hotel. We had to change from a jeep (which took us from station to fort entrance); then to an auto (which took us hardly a minute distance to the fort junction) and finally was helped by some guys taking the luggage and walking to the hotel. The host was apologetic enough about the pick up not turning up but the early morning fiasco did spoil our mood.Having said that rest everything was fantastic. The owners of the property truly believes in the Indian saying \Guest is like god\"" and even opened their private bedroom for us to sleep till the room got vacated and ready by 1000hrs. They even arranged breakfast for us (fantastic parathas; potato dry bhaji and curd) for which the next day Mr.Vyas gracefully declined payment the next day. We stayed in the Maharani room- a large room with period furnishing and interiors. The property has only 4 rooms -each done in a unique style and if you fancy heritage hotel this has lots of it - 400yrs of history. Of course you cannot expect the conveniences of a modern hotel- no TV;no room service or phone. And you would have to be careful not to bang your head on low doors. But to offset it ; you have the thrill of staying in real heritage property.The bathroom is big and has all the convenience of any modern hotel bathroom. The housekeeping although done in 10mnts between check out and our check in was more than adequate- the room was clean.Above all the hosts are gracious people- they don't push safari operators and only recommends when specifically enquired. Both are teachers and their son Mr.Raj Vyas is the one who manages the net correspondence. All of them are extremely helpful and they saw us safely thru a boisterous crowd of holi revellers the next day when we visited them (although we had checked out).The minuses- the way to the property can get a little crowded since it is right on the path to the famed Jain temples of Jaisalmer fort - so no privacy on the balcony when the tourists are around. Getting to the hotel with lots of luggage can be a little tricky since the path is too narrow to be negotiated by even auto rickshaws.However we would happily recommend this property for the hospitality of the owners and for the uniqueness of the rooms""",via Web,Mar-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNNIMAYA,ABUDHABI UAE,108,48,58,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r14657992-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“The best I have had in India so far”,5,3/26/2008,3/26/2008,Although a little more expensive than many other options I stayed in two different rooms here (I stayed once then came back after a safari) and both rooms were excellent. Stunningly decorative interiors- both rooms had pillars around the bed and nice views; aswell as a large bathroom.There are no ceiling fans so huge AC units are supplied which are not the best (and sound like jet engines) but it is only a minor fault and totally excusable when you see the room and facilities.I would not hesitate to recommend it.,via Web,Mar-08,as a couple,4,5,NA,5,5,4,GideonS,Germany,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r14552478-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Hotel Shreenath Palace Jaisalmer,“Living in the Maharani Mahal”,4,03-04-2008,03/04/2008,I stayed in Hotel Shreenath from Feb 22nd to Feb 24th; 2008. It was our first anniversary and we decided to celebrate it in Rajasthan since my better half has never seen desert. We started off our journey from Jaipur to Bikaner and then to Jaisalmer. The stay at this hotel was both homely and royal: homely as the hotel owner Raj and his family took good care of us; royal as the room we stayed was amazing; though I would definitely comeback to stay at the Maharaja's room. Let me start with the facts first:The breakfast; dinner is outsourced to Hotel Sagar which also delivers the food at your room. The food was excellent rather amazing as after hearing a lot about spicy food in Rajasthan and Jaisalmer; we were able to find a place which had great food with very little spice and in very OK price too!! Also the hotel is few steps(literally) away from the famous and beautifully crafted Jain Temple.The Safari which we went was good but not great. Try going to a night safari (I've heard good reviews about it). Also when we went to the sand dunes; we were told that we would be served tea (not told that the milk used would be of a goat). The fort does not require a guide (due to a audio tour available) and stay at Jaisalmer with visit to different locations is not more than 2 days. The room where I stayed was not to huge; with three balconies; all opening to other balconies or walls (so dont expect a breath taking view from the balconies). Having said that ; the room were royally decorated and the toilets were clean. Also ; the hot shower facility was availableI accidently missed my train but Raj was very accomodating in taking care of my luggage while I went for stroll the other day. Thanks for the wonderful stay Raj and given a choice in staying inside the fort ( and just few steps away from the famous Jain temple) ; I would recommend Hotel Shreenath.Rameshwar Nigam,via Web,Feb-08,as a couple,4,4,NA,4,4,5,rameshwarnigam,Gurgaon,5,5,5,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297667-d634711-r14045962-Hotel_Shreenath_Palace-Jaisalmer_Rajasthan.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

From our window we could see a beautiful Jain Temple; and the roof top of the hotel was accessible providing terrific views of the fort interior and beyond (did I mention that the hotel is INSIDE the fort!?!). The hotel is owned/managed by Raj and his father and uncle. It is worth a stay just to meet and be around their family. Everyone was exceptionally generous; kind and friendly; and; incidentally; all could speak perfect English. You feel that you were immediately welcome and taken in as part of their family.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“NO VALUE FOR MONEY”,3,8/14/2013,8/14/2013,i read reviews before visiting this place and my view is its certainly not a value for money .positives are - 1] good ambience and serene place and helps us to relax. 2] treatments and massage are of very good quality . 3] service is decent.NEGATIVE POINTS.1] over priced and over rated for example food they charge 3000 rs per day per couple so if u stay 3 days it will come 9000 rs and food is very bland and simple and u can't go out and eat because its 20 km away from town so u have eat there only.2] rooms are ok but it was smelling fungus due to rains and they won't do anything my wife got itching problem.3] they say discounts but its all very tricky be careful if some one has sold u the coupons.4] nothing is there for entertainment for youngsters avoid this resort.summary - if u are old and and have loads of money to spend and have some chronic problems then visit this place and certainly not 5 star stuff as what they claim.,via Web,Aug-13,as a couple,1,4,2,3,3,3,santhoshshivaji123,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",1,NA,NA,4,4,Room Tip: corner suits,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r172244682-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Oasis of tranquility and green”,5,6/29/2013,6/29/2013,Kairali at Palakkad was one of my most memorable holidays. The resort was not only picturesque; lush and green; filled with trees; water bodies and adorable cottages; but its high levels of personalized service made you feel right at home. From a health angle; the resort was exceptional. I had been suffering from a stomach infection for over a month and a few days at Kairali finally put me out of my misery. The massages; early morning yoga sessions and the clean; fresh air is good enough to cure one of many ailments. To top it off; the food went perfectly with the surroundings. Healthy; light-on-the-stomach and surprisingly scrumptious. The resort is a little isolated but for someone looking to spend some me-time its perfect.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Prince of Palghat offers rejunevation +fun albiet power cut issues”,4,5/21/2013,5/21/2013,We reached the Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort as a part of our trip to Palakkad in our holiday in Kerala. Travelling with family involves some planning and we decided to pre book our travel through the online travel agents Goingkerala.com. The travel agency has an extensive network in Kerala and helped us with our air travel; planning as well as the hotel stay there. The Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort was booked for 3 days and 2 nights. We reached the Coimbatore Airport and the cab was waiting for us and as we reached the resort; which was about 60 odd km from Palakkad or Palghat as it was previously called; we admired by the beauty of the structure of the resort. Moreover the journey itself was through some lovely narrow country lanes and we enjoyed the surroundings and climate of the new place. My kids got enthused seeing the big TV and hopped onto the lovely bed. A whole many number of cushions are provided to ensure a comfortable stay. It was raining slightly and the windows provide a nice view of the moist surroundings which look quite verdant and vibrant given the lawns and gardens. The room had a brick wall like appearance and was clean and well maintained. The wardrobes were of the best teak wood and looked classy. The low lighting at night suited the mood perfectly for a couple and was not too out of place for family as well given that we were on a holiday.There were multiple things to do at the resort. Early morning yoga classes; meditation rooms; the swimming pool and obviously the famous Ayurveda treatments of the resort were quite in vogue and catered to all sections of age group.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Very Good for ayurvedic remedies but they should tk care of adequate power backup”,4,1/20/2013,1/20/2013,I recently visited the Palghat municipality in southern India with my partner. Located near the Palghat Gap; the place is now called Palakkad and the natural pass through the Western Ghats ranges is a favorite amongst tourists who are keen on trying out new places. We booked Package thru Antilog Vacations and they also arranged for our stay at the Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort in the Olassery area there for a period of 3 days and 2 nights & remaining tour at decent rates. I would like to discuss some positives and negatives about the place in my review here:Positives:1. The location though not in the conventional road but is just 1-2 kms inside and the locales should help you spot the exact position if you say Kairali. We reached in late afternoon and the serene location provided us a view of an amazing sunset upon arrival. 2. The resort has an in house doctor for emergencies.3. If you're really into following Ayurveda; then this is the place for you as the medicinal practices are quite renowned here and the spa and therapies are also rejuvenating and relaxing.4. The rooms are generally named after a star or nakshatram as it is called here and are available equipped with various facilities. 5. The resort keeps in house umbrellas given that it rains frequently and hence its ok even if you land up without any rain protections as we did.6. The pool was large and furnished with a small steam Jacuzzi.Negatives:1. The place is haunted with frequent power shedding and hence there were some periods of darkness. The backup inverter worked but then again you could not switch on all the appliances.2. Mosquitoes are quite high in number in the area and you would be advised to bring your own coils or repellants to keep these at bay.,via Web,Jan-13,as a couple,3,4,4,3,3,3,Sahil S,kolkata,2,NA,2,1,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r150096273-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“It's OK”,3,10/21/2012,10/21/2012,"Back last Tuesday after a trip to Kairali resort; Palakkad as part of a promo voucher that we bought last year.First about reaching this place - its a drive of approx 8 hrs(comfortably without rush driving) - never mind the distance by kms and doing a basic math of D/T. And 8 hrs IF you leave Bangalore early say by 6 AM. We live in Domlur - so took the Bangalore-Hosur-Krishnagiri-Dharmapuri-Thoppur (took a deviation here)-Mettur Dam-Bhavani-Coimbatore and finally Palakkad. Now about quality of road. Bangalore-Hosur(Toll road - good - via elec city);Hosur-Krishnagiri (WAS good; now cut at various places some construction going on. It was raining in the morning with some truck traffic -this section was annoying); Krishnagiri - Dharmapuri -Toppur(very good - maintained average of 110 kmph - touched 130 top); Toppur-Mettur-Bhavani (average to bad - state roads you would pass via some small town/villages in between. Scenic than Salem route but looking at the quality I would recommend Salem route to anyone; though Salem has heavy truck traffic); Bhavani-Perundarai (Excellent - can maintain average 110 kmph); Perundurai - Coimbatore (Pathetic - roads under construction - full of potholes and deviatioin at multiple places); Coimbatore - Palakkad bypass (Pathetic again - Walayar checkpost is just disastorous especially after rains). From Palakkad ask for a place \Pulpuli\"" from locals. Resort is about 10 kms from Palakkad. Resort is in a very very remote place. You would just be under \""resort arrest\"" if not going by your own transport. You would need car for movement. After sleeping for few hours (it was sole driving with just one stop - had left B'lore at 6 AM reaching resort at 1:30 PM!); we walked around resort - its full of coconut and few other trees. As we were to leave back on Monday; we decided not to waste whole of Sunday again driving too much - and just visit nearby Palakkad city including Tippu fort; Malampuzha dam and back. It was not too bad - quite hot in the morning though. On Sunday evening I had a good oil massage in the resort - quite relaxing. Early dinner on Sunday night at resort (food is average -of course its more for \""treatment\"" than suiting taste buds. It included few phulkas; cabbage sabji; herbal soup; curd rice (no dal or sambar - dont ask for it); one coconut sweet. After discount food costed about 225 pp - not bad. Anyways; only other alternate is drive for 15 kms and reach Palakkad town!!To be honest; we went there ONLY because we bought this voucher last year for some reason. On our way back; we drove via Conoor; Ooty; Bandipur and Mysore -because of bad roads from Palakkad to Coimbatore; ghat section and a tree fall to our ill luck the whole drive took 10 hrs. O/N at Mysore and again drove back to Bangalore the next early morning. It was very tiring trip and felt like taking another holiday after this trip.Now about the resort - I've already mentioned about the food and its location. Resort is OK. Rooms good. Each unit is named after a star (nakshatram). Frequent power outage - but they have back up. It rained very heavy with thunder and lightning every evening. Resort has umbrellas - but good to carry your own as they've shortage at times and you would need to depend on someone to get it. Phones were out of order - I understand after a heavy lightning few days ago phones went off - for every thing I had to physically walk up to reception. There are NO shops nearby - so please make sure you carry all your medical needs and snacks. Rooms have both AEH and regular power points. Beds and linen are clean - not too great; not too bad either.All in all -this is a trip if you happen to be like one of us who has ended up buying the voucher OR have got nothing else to do OR got a ayurvedic treatment out there. Its not a place to exclusively look forward to - but anyways if you want to go try to spend at least 2-3 days staying in the resort else would end up as a very tiring trip if you are driving all the day. Also; make sure you have your own transport as there is absolutely nothing you can do sitting in the resort - unless; of course the only thing you want to do is eat all your 3 meals in resort; just be lying on the bed and read a book.Cheers;Sunith""",via Web,Oct-12,as a couple,3,3,4,4,4,4,Sunith79,"Bangalore, India",3,3,3,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r143330588-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

We were not there to participate in any of the treatment sessions it was just a stop over to relax in tranquil surroundings for 1 night. The cottage was average; although; the bed clothes could have been cleaner; not sure it the sheets had been changed. Lots of mosquitoes around; they did spray at night.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Only for those seeking therapies”,4,10-01-2012,10/01/2012,A radio contest prize gave us a complimentary stay at Kairali Resort. We included a stop at the resort on the route on a road trip and headed there last week. The resort is idyllic and situated in the heart of a village. So there's no option for alternative dining options in the vicinity. The quality of highways across Kerala is terrible so if you are driving there factor in additional time to deal with narrow streets; heavy truck traffic; village and town life pouring onto the highway and potholes every few meters. The resort is sprawling with beautiful cottages across the expanse. Every cottage has a name and each one is unique. Our cottage named Chothi was comfortable and clean. What was funny were the Mangalore tiles on the ceiling that were heart shaped cut outs amidst an otherwise white ceiling.All meals are served at the dining hall that overlooks green from every window. The menu is printed and pinned onto a board at the entrance. We did not see an a la carte menu but did not miss it. The efficient waiters served each course with warmth and a smile. Every meal has herbal warm water; a soup; salad; papad; two vegetable preparations; a pulse preparation; curd; pickle; chapatis; rice and a desert. Most of the ingredients are sourced off the property itself and the entire meal features very little oil. It's health food and detox that are the highlights of the resort.The yoga and treatment sessions seem expensive and when on a treatment package there are a list of guidelines that have to be followed: No swimming; no sex; no non veg; no alcohol......the list is long and every room has a copy of the do's and dont's. We opted not to go in for the treatments and so thoroughly enjoyed the large; clean swimming pool set amidst towering trees and flowering plants.A man made narrow river runs through the entire undulating property and when the motor is turned on; the water flows around gurgling and ending in a fountain. However when this is off and there is inadequate water within each section you do wonder about mosquitoes. The water in certain areas does give off a peculiar odour too.At dusk the mosquito problem is dealt with by an incense fumigation and it would be best to stay indoors until the mosquito hours have passed.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Not too Good; Not Bad either”,3,8/21/2012,8/21/2012,We visited the resort over long weekend from Bangalore and not for any Ayurvedic therapy. The resort has lot of greenery; that was one thing that I was expecting and I liked the most. We paid 3000 for 2 nights and 3 days; (only cottages); got some discounts on B/F; lunch; dinner (Not on other food we order). some of the cottages are smaller even with one small kid; but otherwise are cozy. We did not plan to do lot of activities or sight seeing. We spend 6-7 hours for going around. Malampuzha Dam is worth if you are with kids 5-12 years of age. They can definitely improve w.r.t. the food service; i.e. we had to wait for Breakfast; and after that also the service took quite longer.Moreover the options in restaurant are very limited.Overall not very good; not very bad experience.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Got to be into Ayurveda to make the most of this place”,3,5/15/2012,5/15/2012,Booked this 2 night stay through Groupon - perhaps a little naively as they're renowned for their misadvertisements. I'm not especially into Ayurveda; but I like massages and thought this would be a nice place to relax and start our Kerala exploration. It was an OK experience; but a little bit non-eventful compared to the rest of our amazing trip to India.The resort is a little awkward to get to; so it was a taxi ride from Calicut. It's set amongst some lovely country lanes and we enjoyed exploring the walkable surroundings. The room was in a small brick house; clean. Quite atmospheric at night with the low lighting. The resort itself was a little dated and lacked soul or indeed much to do full stop. A yoga class at 6.45am. Meditation at 7pm. Three meals per day. A pool. And Ayurveda treatments. We were tied into to cafeteria food; which luckily was plentiful and very wholesome (if sometimes a little on the bland side) though we had expected this to be included in the price considering there were no other eating options in the vicinity and therefore there was no choice but to eat there. The kitchen/waiting staff there were absolutely lovely and probably the best thing about the resort. They clearly put a lot of thought into every meal.My husband and I each enjoyed a 4-handed massage followed by the steam machine and lazed by the pool for several hours afterwards. The Ayurvedic staff were also very pleasant and seemed good at what they did. The gym was very small and uninviting and I decided to skip a short workout because of this.Felt very relaxed after 48 hours at Kairali but were ready to leave and get on with our trip onto which it felt like a pause button had been hit. We might have gotten on with our trip sooner had it not been for the misguided advice given to us on how to reach Munnar: the front desk staff advised us a journey time of approximately 2.5 hours with 2 changes. In the end; it took us 9 hours and we had to change 5 times! As for Kairali Health Resort itself; go if you're really into Ayurveda. If you're after a few days of relaxation at a nice resort but not that bothered about Ayurveda; I suggest go elsewhere.,via Web,May-12,as a couple,3,3,4,3,4,4,mjkens,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",64,19,32,7,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r129964566-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Especially overpriced”,3,12/19/2011,12/19/2011,Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort is located in a nice and quiet area in the middle of the rice plantations. The garden and pool are relaxing. BUT the rooms are getting old (the bath room seems to be 10 years old); the doctor's advice (we had the lady - the old man seems to be much better) was not automatic and did not really give a professionnal feeling. The massage was done in a hurry; so did not at all relax me.

I was assured that there was a good filter system. I wanted to swim but there was a smell in the pool. Sometimes I noticed frogs in the pool and the workers; upon request; fished them out. I believe the pool was being fixed so may be in better condition now. There was a gym with only one threadmill. This caused problems as there were three of us and were not able to work out together. I also noticed the lack of a good jogging/walking track. For a decent walk; we had to go outside the resort. A facility of this calibre perhaps needs to assess the fitness portion and make it available to the guests through series of classes/upgraded equipment. However; a yoga class was available every morning which was a great start to the day.

I left the place feeling that I could not have made a better choice than Kairali. The management; staff; therapists; and doctors are superb. Like it usually happens in any resort setting; hospitality; quality in service thins out in a day or two after you check in. But; here; the consistency in service and quality remained the same throughout my stay. Positive vibrations in this property is something that should be experienced. It provides an ideal cathartic atmosphere for receiving ayurvedic treatment and relaxation thereafter. If you want a resort that focuses on ayurvedic treatment delivered in its pristine form; this is the place for you to be; That said; wish the liibraries were equipped better; It gets a tad boring when the sun goes down.

Lovely gardens and pretty location; very welcoming staff throughout and a wide range of good; well executed Ayurveda treatments. I booked a 14 day 'Rejuvenation and Detoxification' Package and was very pleased with the overall results. I felt much more refreshed at the end of my stay than I had when I arrived! I also took advantage of the Yoga and Meditation classes and found them very worthwhile.My biggest disappointment was the food. There was nothing wrong with it as such: it just became so monotonous for the second week of my stay. I was of course on a 'strict diet' but that does not mean the food has to be boring! In the end; I lost my appetite as I was not enjoying the food. There needs to be a choice and there needs to be much more variety.The property advertises that it has a swimming pool: yes it does but the water was so cloudy that I did not use it once during my stay. The whole pool area is very tired as is the tennis court. If any hotel offers these facilities; then they have to be usable! You should be able to see the bottom quite clearly of any swimming pool i.e. the water should be crystal clear. This needs to be rectified as soon as possible as the pool area badly lets the hotel down and unless guests are happy to swim in cloudy water; then they will not use it!The 'Business Centre' is OK but again rather tired. It suited my purpose in that I could access my office e-mails via the Internet but the equipment is quite old although functional.

It was a peaceful almost soul-calming experience. The lush green gardens; the wonderful staff and the great overall environment was a big positive. On top of that the ayurvedic spa treatments were also an amazing experience. Having been to many different resorts across the country I fell that Kairali definitley is in the top 2-3 as far as enjoying a great peaceful holiday in one of the gems of the Indian Subcontinent i.e. Kerela.

I personally had a splendid time and would recommend others to experience the beautiful resort for the services it has to offer. The resort was everything i expected it to be and more. The rooms are very clean and spacious. There were little touches like flowers in the bathroom; bedroom and on arrival.The massage itself was a feeling that is indescribable. The warmth of the oil and its fragrances brings out a soothing massage.The staff are courteous and very helpful. Everyone at the resort went above the call of duty which is a lovely touch.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Ideal Rejuvenation”,4,1/26/2007,1/26/2007,I visited Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort in February 2006 and I really need to emphasize on the rejuvenating experience I had there. First of all; Kerala is one of my favourite states in India partly because it is so lush and green – and Kairali Resort is situated in the most ideal location; Palakkad. Initially; I came across the resort through a recommendation from a friend. I recall my hesitancy when I first browsed the resort website; making me wonder how ‘nice’ the location could be if you can’t even see the ‘tiny’ pictures on display! But the site claimed that it was a “perfect place for a discerning traveller” and having crossed my fingers; I thought I should be adventurous enough to pay it a visit!Now that I look back; I should admit it was one of the most “marvellous” risks I have taken. India is a diverse land and variety is what it offers best! Unfortunately with the Indian economy opening up; we see more commercialisation and foreign-tourist attractions taking over. You will see high-rise and non-environmental buildings propping up as world-class 5 Star Hotels; but not one has the unique Indian services at offer. If you plan to be pampered; please go to the 7 star hotels where food will be served at your convenience and hotel managers will appease you at the sight of your cash-flow. But; if you want to encounter and experience raw culture and traditions; then let Kairali mesmerize you. Though; I really wish the resort named itself a “health farm” as it states in its website; for that is what it is – truly invigorating. The resort has allocates rooms according to one's zodiac signs (they believe that your characteristic attributes will be in co-ordination with your zodiac sign; hence put you in the right correlations with nature). It has the most eco-friendly atmosphere and is perfect to relax and unwind (I got to spend my time rather fruitful and undisturbed).You wake up to a healthy life of yoga; followed by specially designed health massages and served with food in its purest form. You have time to idealise and meditate…you have the leisure of walking through nature and being at peace within. And as one reviewer mentioned; you come across a diverse group of visitors and make some lasting friendships (two of the people I met during my stay are going back to visit Kairali and I plan to do the same ritual).A quality of thought is a state of mind. I highly recommend Kairali for the traveller who has seen imperfection and understood it in the global world. Once we comprehend and digest the fact that imperfection is only a human condition; I think in a deeper sense; Kairali will fulfils one's desires. And; I truly have high respect for the team who work at Kairali for they do not advertise themselves with deceiving intentions (namely publicize things that they are not; or can not offer).During my stay; I came across individuals who were not content…the reason: it’s a vegetarian resort?! There is no entertainment?! The variety of food is restrictive?! The massage oils stink?! The lakes/water streams look muddy and dirty?! And my response – absurdity! Nature is not perfect.It’s a vegetarian resort because it is a health farm designed to cleanse your system and annihilate your health problems. Ayurvedic treatments depend on certain strategies which need to be followed and practiced.If there is no entertainment; it is because it permits you to not rely on materialistic possessions but rather use nature as your source of comfort. If the massage oils stink; it is merely because they are not flourished with chemical scents but herbs that will ultimately alleviate your health problems -- (it did a lot of good to my lower back problem!)And finally; must I comment on why the lake/ water streams look muddy and dirty?! For I have never come across an ocean green and see-through one.I wish Kairali and its team the best‘est’ of luck in their future endeavours and I am certain that if they continue to service their customers in genuineness; they will flourish into a world-class health farm...irrespective of reviews that diverge into various perspectives.PS: before I left; I had the chance to meet the owner and as a humble suggestion; I requested if they could focus more on improving their online website; especially the extremely tiny pictures which were not pleasant to the eye. To my surprise; I received an email in April thanking me for my views and how the website is being retransformed to offer better resources online (even translations in other languages).There is always room for improvement; if it’s expressed in an amicable way.,via Web,Jan-07,solo,4,5,NA,4,3,4,MN2007,Delhi,3,3,3,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r6694820-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

So I told him: \Goodbye\""; but he still kept staying in my room; so I became frightened and I strenghtly opened the door and I pushed ihm out. After that I talked to the manager; he apologized and fired the boy. And he told me: \""Please forget it; don't tell it anyone; you can have every drink complimentary.......\"".But I can't forget.And I can't forget the catastrophic reception service.They woke me up 2 times at 5.30 o' clock; but I didn't ordered the wake up call!!!!1 time I ordered it; but they forgot to call me.I waited for 2 or 3 important e-mails; they couldn't find them on their computer; and this is not an exception. It happened the same to some other people .My husband called me in the evening; they didn't pick up the phone.......And at the end the bill was not correct; and I had to complain again......So; even if the garden is beautiful (the pool side has only 4 deck-chairs; and you have to reserve one already at 8.00 o'clock!) I couldn't relax very well because everyday another problem was expecting me........The hygiene in the treatments rooms is not very good. Sometimes I asked them to change the towels where I had to sit or where I had to put my head for the treatment because they were VISIBLY dirty.

Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Kairali saga”,1,01-09-2007,01/09/2007,This is a two-star resort at the most. My husband and I went there to get a week-long ayurvedic treatment and to relax. I am also a journalist and travel writer and was hoping to write a story on the resort. But my own experiences and those of most of the guests at the hotel made us leave three nights after we got there. We had paid in advance and were refused a refund; but I made a call to the owner of the resort who lives in Delhi and threatened to sue him if he didn't give us back our money. We managed to get our money back and leave. And I want other travelers to know our Kairali saga so they never go to this resort.First; the treatment was terrible. The two doctors are clueless and massaged me with an oil repeatedly even after they found out I was allergic to it. I developed a bad rash and my husband; a doctor; had to run around all night to try and get me to the nearest hospital. We never made it to the hospital because Kairali has no means of moving guests out during a night emergency. To make matters worse there is no first aid kit onsite and the night I suffered a rash the resort water supply was shut off so I could not wash off the oil.The rooms are just ok and the bathrooms terrible. The kitchen is good but the options are limited. Other services are below standard as well.What saves the day are the beautiful gardens but that is the last thing you notice when you are sick and unhappy! Strangely; we made some great friends while we were there because everyone was bonding in the face of Kairali misery. In fact; we all vowed to put up a website trashing the resort. But we feel sad for the local employees at the mercy of an owner who has very little business sense and fewer ethics....So BEWARE of Kairali.,via Web,Jan-07,NA,NA,4,NA,2,1,2,senhar,Newton,1,NA,NA,7,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1096235-d530306-r6567653-Kairali_Ayurvedic_Health_Resort-Palakkad_Kerala.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Kairali Ayurvedic Health Resort Palakkad,“Relaxing ayurvedic lifestyle and treatments”,3,01-04-2006,01/04/2006,As a hotel; this resort does not get a high rating from us; but as an Ayurveda Center it offers a lot. Treatment start with a consultation; then you are prescribed some sort of ayurvedic massage. This massage is done by using lots of oil with long strokes. Two therapists massage you at the same time. It was relaxing but hygiene of the massage bed and the oil created lots of questions in my mind. Food is fresh; clean and very tasty. I should also mention that it is strictly vegetarian and ayurvedic. Days start with a yoga class under the coconut trees and end with a meditation session. It can be quite relaxing here. But then again this depends on your expectations and personality. Resort area is nice with coconuts and lawns around the brick cottages. Rooms are not as nice. Uncomfortable beds; lots of concrete; tasteless decoration. Resort is surrounded by beautiful paddies and sweet little village houses; but don't expect to see these unless you step outside.

Lotus Nikko Hotel Bodhgaya Bodh_Gaya,“Basic but served the purpose”,3,11/22/2013,11/22/2013,We were booked for three nights as we were doing the Bodh Gaya - Nalanda - Rajgir circuit. We were out of the hotel by 9 every morning; and back in time for dinner (included in the tariff) and bed. I think the hotel management knows that this is the case with most guests; as it offers the basic amenities for travellers and ignores the rest (the 'garden' was just an overgrown patch of land).From this perspective; the hotel was adequate: clean (though not sparkling); the bedlinen fresh and clean-smelling; and most important; plenty of hot water even late at night. We didn't need to use the a/c; for which I'm grateful given that other reviewers have said that it is quite noisy. The fan as also mentioned only worked on the highest speed; but given that the weather was quite pleasant when we went; we did without and just opened the window.It is very close to the Maha Bodhi temple and the several other temples erected by other Buddhist nations.The menu for breakfast and dinner was adequate; though the buffet offered every night was certainly lacking in imagination.The staff are friendly and helpful; especially in the restaurant; which we much appreciated.The hotel seems to be a favourite of groups of pilgrims from Southeast Asia and the Far East. They tend to be quite noisy; and their early-morning comings and goings did disturb my sleep.

There are substantial renovations going on; but there are not a lot of choices available thoroughout the Buddhist \""Pilgrimage\"" areas. There was no one else staying at the Hotel when we checked in for our 2 day stay; ( a family of 3 checked in later that evening) but we were put into a ground floor room that frankly was disgusting. The bathroom was putrid and smelt of raw sewerage; the bed and the room itself also smelt worse than anything we had discovered in the streets anywhere we had been and the AC did not work. We didn't even have the bags put down before I was in the foyer demanding another room. I was already beginning to dread this part of the trip; knowing we were already booked into 2 more Lotus Nikko Hotels in Kushinighar and Lumbini and we had heard they were not very good. Fortunately both were in better condition. The one in Lumbini was actually very nice.Management; did not even blink; quickly apologized and put us in another room on the 2nd floor which was at least reasonably clean with working AC. Makes you wonder why; with all the choices of rooms available in the Hotel; they didn't think to put us in this room in the first place; but this is the sort of thing that happens in India; where even though they are great people and it is a fantastic country to travel in; they haven't quite come to grips with thinking about the best and most logical options first for the welfare and comfort of their tourist guests.Anyway; the staff were very gracious and could not do enough provide good service; were very friendly and certainly made a good attempt to make up for the bad start. We ate in the restaurant here; for breakfast and supper as this was included in the price. Food was actually pretty good as we stuck to basics; chicken curries; soups and Kingfisher beer and again the service was very good. No king or double beds here and no credit cards. Also very hard to get any change or small notes from reception; but that is true throughout India. Took 2 days for them to get change for 1000 RP which is less than $20.00; so while we had meals included in the price for the Hotel; buying water and beer was a problem. But we just ran a tab and tipped the staff at the end of the stay.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Disaster of a holiday!”,1,10-11-2014,10/11/2014,Based on TripAdvisor reviews; we narrowed down on Mahua Bagh given its off-beat location and the fact that it wouldn't be a very touristy place - boy what a mistake that was. The place clearly needs an overhaul!!!Our woes began right from the time we stepped on the property. We were a family of 5 and booked the new cottages; one of our cottages was unkempt and the bed linen seemed like they were not washed for days. Moreover; our cottage had a shared door with the staff quarters thus totally violating ones privacy - we immediately asked to move to another room. Most of the staff was new; untrained; clueless and displayed total apathy in servicing the guests. Complaints of poor service and unclean rooms seemed to resonate from all visitors over that weekend - I hope the management has duly taken note!!!Most of the meals were delayed - breakfast wasn't served until 9:30 am and lunch until 2 pm. Food was served in the open garden (not a good idea in the scorching Oct heat and moths hovering at night) and very average. Clearly; the property wasn't prepared to serve guests for the opening weekend after monsoon. Although the reviews did warn us about the power cuts; the place clearly has water shortage issues as well. We were required to flag the staff several times to notify that there was no water in the rooms. The place does not offer potable water as well - one is required to purchase packaged water at Rs. 30 a bottle.The current manager; Manish Singh (who claims to be a naturalist) gave misguided directions to the nearby Phansad sanctuary. It is sad that after such good reviews and pleasant experience from past visitors; Mahua Bagh is not living up to its reputation. It charges mid-segment rates for poor quality service.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Please avoid this place”,1,10-03-2014,10/03/2014,I visited this place with family on 2 October 2014. The first downer was the approach road to the property which is a 1.5 Kms patch of single car width jungle trek path. Was hoping to find something scenic on the other side of this treacherous drive but found nothing but a shabby fishing village. The property is not really a resort. It is a farmhouse which they are trying to turn into a resort.As this was the opening day of the season the facility was not at all in top shape. All the guests were had some or the other complaint with housekeeping.The food was OK; nothing to complain about. Staff was quite helpful.Once you reach here there is absolutely nothing much to do. There is no beach within walking distance where you can go and enjoy. So basically if your idea of the vacation is to just to go somewhere and not do anything at all; the place is OK. Otherwise you will have to risk you car every time you wish to move around.,via Web,Oct-14,with family,1,NA,3,NA,NA,3,ShirishL123,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r232470771-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“A Holiday - as it should be...!!”,5,6/18/2014,6/18/2014,ur stay at Mahua Baugh from 12-14 April was really wonderful. I would comment on three specific points1. Beautiful location - This is a 25 acre farm of mango; chikoo; banana...plantations making you feel relaxed and away from city life. You can walk down to the beach from here in five min.2. Accommodation -there are two sets of 6 cottages - old and new. Old ones are build on a minor hill. Day 1 we stayed at the top most old cottage which has an excellent view of the entire farm and is onlooking sea. Day 2 we stayed at the new one all of which are at ground level and have an open shower; solar water heater and TV. Both types of cottages are really big; neat and well maintained. You can choose either of them.3. Food and Staff Excellent food; cooked only for guests and served in open air arrangement adding to the farm feel. Staff is very courteous; Shival Jain- farm incharge; Shyam; Kaka; Michael; Kisan and others made our stay comfortable along with three pet dogs Gypsy; Jap and Sheru made us feel secured.We will certainly visit again.,via Web,Apr-14,as a couple,4,4,5,4,5,4,AnkitCatriona,"Mumbai, India",1,NA,NA,2,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r210952678-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Great Service; peaceful location”,4,06-09-2014,06/09/2014,We had a most wonderful time at Mahua Bagh. Location: It is in between Kashid and Murud. The beach is about 5 mins walk from the resort. The resort is at a pretty isolated location; so other than a few local kids playing cricket; you have the beach to yourselves.Service: Service is excellent; with Sudeep and team catering to our every need immediately. Food :We stayed for 4 nights; but no dish was repeated. Every meal outdid the previous one. The food was healthy; tasty and made with produce grown at the bagh. It was served under a mango tree making for some very relaxing meal times.Rooms: We stayed at the old rooms for their view; they are big and comfortable with an old world charm. The new rooms have open showers and TVs. Though the power cuts were frequent; there was no problem with the AC as the resort has a generator. The resort needs to add some amenities like a swimming pool; children's play area etc.We would definitely visit it again.,via Web,May-14,with family,4,5,4,4,4,5,msmumbai,"Mumbai, India",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r209541699-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“A relaxing Getaway”,4,5/18/2014,5/18/2014,Mahua Bagh wouldn't suit your idea of an ideal resort with 24 hours of A/c;room service facilities etc but goes much beyond that; in the warmth and affection that the limited staff present provide you with.If you are too accustomed to sitting and chilling out in the confines of your room then this isn't a place for you;definitely not in the summer's. But if you don't mind sitting out in the open and just relaxing out this is definitely the place for you. Not that they don't provide you with A/c in the rooms;it's present but for a limited period in the nite after dinner and in the noons after lunch.This is due to the frequent power outs in the area. And though we were a group of 8 persons with small children including my 7 month old son; we didn't find it so much of a drawback but others might not find it appealing; specially in this heat. This and the approach road are probably the only drawbacks that anyone can encounter here. We reached the place late on Friday Nite after a long Drive from Mumbai and it might get a little difficult to spot the place in the dark due to absence of sign-age on the last 1 km stretch but if you contact the local in-charge;he will not only guide only but also comes out on his bike to assist you.He did this for all of us since all of us couples were traveling separately and all of us got a littlelost towards the end and also did the same for my friend who came alone early morning at 2 am.The food at the Bagh was amazing;the veg fare included. Never enjoyed veg food so much including their home made pickles Quite a few of the vegetables that they use are grown in their own farms. Moving on to the rooms we stayed in the 4 new cottages and quite preferred them over the old cottages. The old cottages have a nice view of the beach but the new ones allow us a lot of space for the children to play and move around. which wud'nt be possible at the old cottages. The old cottages therefore would be preferable for couples more than families according to me. Room nos 5&6 have an open shower included which is pretty cool.All the new cottages have a television set and a fridge. There are 3 very playful dogs on the farm;Gypsy the biggest of them all is a darling. And I can't complete this review without mentioningthe Hospitality of the staff Mr Shivlal; Micheal; Mahesh; Sudeep and all included. They really made us feel at home and gave us service which was better than a 5 star hotel. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and is prepared to let go a few frills of luxury.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Blissful country retreat by the sea.”,4,4/13/2014,4/13/2014,If you like rural simplicity; delicious home grown food; the sound of the sea and a cool breeze blowing through coconut palms this is the place for you. If you prefer 5 star luxury and all mod-cons then maybe think again. Mahua Bagh is a peaceful retreat; beautifully furnished and tastefully decorated. We stayed in one of the newer a.c. rooms which had a fantastic modern bathroom with regular hot water and a sunken shower area; a cool veranda where sometimes our meals were served by the very friendly and helpful staff; and also where the lovely dogs would snooze in the heat of the day. Mostly; meals were served in the shade of the mango trees whilst the chickens scratched around us. The food was freshly prepared and some of the best we have eaten whilst in India; indeed anywhere. Taking a break from the heat; noise and busy city life of Pune where my husband has been working; we were exploring this part of the coast and didn't know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The beach which you can walk to when the tide is out is long; silver and mostly empty. The road is winding; potholed and the place hard to find but it is worth it. The only complaint is that the curtains; mats and bed spreads were not clean and I used my own scarves and throws to sleep under. For a place at this price and wanting to encourage visitors; it should be a priority to keep it clean and the bins in the rooms emptied sometimes. That said however we still recommend the place very much. The positive elements far outweigh the few glitches.

The tiny villages adorning the the property which were extraordinarily simple and beautiful. Although short staffed due to the Holiday season; the villagers cum room service help were way too polite and courteous. This enriching experience in Solitude cannot be described by words alone.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Mahua Bagh - Peaceful Paradise”,4,3/27/2014,3/27/2014,My husband and I visited Mahua Bagh for a 2 night stay from 21-23 March 2014. It is situated at Nandgaon; mid-way between Kashid and Murud. We were very happy with the service; food and ambience at this place.On arrival; Mr Shival; their manager and Sudeep; one of the staff welcomed us with a refreshing drink of home-made limbu pani. Since we were the only guests on that day; we were shown all the rooms to choose whichever one we liked; we finally decided on one of the older rooms; as it was at a slight height; and with a view of the beach. All the rooms were basic; but very airy; bright and cosy. Linen and bath towels were clean; and basic toiletries were provided. A couple of the newer ones even have open-to-sky showers.I must mention the food: all meals were included in our package; and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Since this is a farm; a lot of the vegetables & fruits are grown on site; and they make their own pickles and chutneys from the fresh produce. Meals are served outdoors; on the lawn; under the shade of huge mango trees. Fresh fish is available on request. All the dishes we were served were freshly cooked and very tasty with huge portions. Service is really excellent; and Mr. Shival; Sudeep and the other staff were very attentive to the guests' needs and made one feel completely at home. We were offered tea and evening snacks too; which is very rare in most package deals. Everyone was always very courteous and friendly.Pet lovers will really enjoy this place; as there are three loving dogs on the property; Gypsy; a huge but gentle giant; Sheru; the quiet one and Jap; the most energetic and mischievous of the lot. You can even get your own pets to this farm; they are welcome here. As dog lovers; we were very happy to have the three dogs around us to play with. The dogs even guided us to the beach; which is about 5 minutes away from the property.The only (minor) negatives were lack of a paved access road to the property (which is apparently because it is near the Phansad sanctuary; and the government doesn't allow construction of paved roads) and the electricity problem which the region faces. There are frequent power cuts; and though the resort has a generator; it is not always sufficient to power the entire resort. This could be a problem in the summer if the ACs and fans don't work.Overall; it is a great place for a weekend break for couple and families. The fresh air; yummy food; superlative service and playing with the dogs will rejuvenate you for the gruelling week ahead.

Reaching the resort was fairly easy as we were informed in advance (by zarahutke.in the site we booked our stay on) about the last one kilometer being an unfinished road.That part of the road wasn't as bad as we expected and very short. The farmstay's location is perfect if you want a secluded and quiet holiday. It's barely a minutes walk from the beach and the farm itself on which the cottages are located is lovely. The pets are friendly; the staff is courteous; the rooms are minimalistic and clean. The place is well kept and inviting. They have lots of games including board games and badminton. They have solar powered geysers; which means 24 hours hot water in the shower!During our stay; the staff promptly arranged a bonfire and a moonlight boat ride for us; which was beautiful! And they also didn't hesitate to bring us some supplies we needed from the market.The food was home cooked delicious; especially the alu parathas. The staff generously offer to give their guests their farm grown vegetables and fruits; which is fantastic. The only things we missed were mirrors in the rooms (there was just one in the bathroom) and no telephones to call for water/ guests in other rooms.We look forward to staying at Mahua Bagh again and have already recommended it to all our loved ones.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Exclusive; quiet and old-worldly...”,4,2/17/2014,2/17/2014,This was my second visit to the Bagh and I was delighted to see that this place has managed to preserve its elegance and calm. Mahua Bagh's distance from the more commercialized places like Murud and Kashid provides you exclusivity and quietness which I find as its best qualities.However; I fear that the new construction (cottages towards the coastal end of the property) and a host of other upcoming hotel-like facilities/developments (TVs in all rooms; Indoor Dining Hall; Swimming Pool etc.) at this rustic farmhouse would rob its old-world-close-to-nature charm which I have so much come to love and adore.This time again; The hospitality has been amongst best I've experienced along the Konkan coast and the staff performs beyond their duties to provide you a great service. (I have had a great experience at their Mahua Vann resort at Pench as well.) The staff gladly arranged for a bonfire at night and an early morning boating trip on a local fishing boat on our request.Their home-cooked style of food has always been easy on the gut and full of flavors. Would love to see more of a local influence on the food though. Local Konkani food would be more suited for this sort of setting instead of the regular North Indian menu. Non vegetarian food (Chicken) however has lost its edge as compared to my last stay here in 2012. The culinary highlight of this stay was the specially ordered and beautifully cooked Fish Fry.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Amidst mango trees.... lies Mahua!!!!”,4,1/20/2014,1/20/2014,I chanced upon this place while browsing for a weekend getaway. I visited Mahua Bagh in the month of May 2013; when summer is at its peak; and thinking of a beach getaway at that point of time is practically uncalled for. Yes; Mahua Bagh is located along a beach; they have their own private access to a beach. This place is full of mango trees; infact the welcome drink was a mango panna; which was so refreshing.... I asked for another serving!!! The food was different; cooked the north Indian style; so if you expect the local cuisine; you might have to specifically ask for it; I did not. Incidentally there were no other guests; and we had all the place for ourselves. There was a lot of mango in the food; be it pulp; be it juice; we truly enjoyed being the 'Mango People' that time. The rooms are spacious enough; please remember you are in the midst of a large plantation and you'd find pests and cattle around. Don't be afraid; they mind their own business.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Literally off the beaten path!”,4,01-02-2014,01/02/2014,We chanced upon Mahua Bagh on tripadvisor; while searching for a quiet place to spend this new year’s eve at - away from partying hordes and reasonably close to drive to; from Mumbai. The hotel website made the property look inviting and we got a prompt reply to our online query. A little back and forth with the contact person got us a confirmed package (all meals inclusive) for 3 nights. We specifically asked for a ‘new’ room; based on tripadvisor reviews. It took us about 4 hours to drive down from Mumbai. We had been forewarned by Mahua Bagh and other tripadvisor reviewers about the ‘kachcha’ dirt track to approach Mahua Bagh; once we steered off the state highway after Mazgaon village. A rough; 1 kilometre-long-ride later; we were fetched by Sudeep – one of the smiling; eager to help staffers. The entrance is on a slope and is easy to miss. We noticed a lot of other guests needed help with locating the place; so a signpost along the dirt track will definitely help! Mahua Bagh has 6 cottages in a cascade on a small hillock and a large connected complex of 5 cottages on the ground level at the entrance to the property. We were shown 2 options of rooms to choose from the set of ground level cottages and we opted for room number 3; which had basic; vintage wooden furniture; a very noisy little fridge and no wardrobe. The bed-cover and curtains were a little grubby; but the rest of the bed linen; towels and blankets were fresh and spotlessly clean. A door at the end of the room opened into a delightful little open courtyard; through which we could access the airy bathroom which had lots of natural light. There was a sunken bath; moderately heated water from the solar heater; basic toiletries (1 sachet of shampoo and 1 small Lifebuoy soap). The toilet seat could do with fixing. On our second day there; we moved to room number 5; which had a nicer layout; was airier; brighter; had better furniture; a private sit-out and a charming open air rain shower; as well as a better bathroom. The simple; delicious meals here are served alfresco under the breezy shade of Alphonso mango trees and cooked home style. Lunch is a completely vegetarian affair and there is a chicken curry for dinner (on request). We were very disappointed that there was no sea food on offer; despite the property’s proximity to a fishing village and the coast. There are different dessert options in every meal like kheer; custard; rasgullas; gulab jamuns. The alu parathas at breakfast deserve a special mention – they are simply terrific. Eggs on request are also done well and tea time is great; with a robust ‘adrak’ chai and crisp potato-onion pakodas. We noticed a lot of recently planted coconut palms and some old mango trees; but didn’t come across any vegetable patches or fruit trees; though the website and staff claim the meals are cooked from fresh produce off the land. While Mahua Bagh is close to the coast; the beach nearby is rocky and you would need to drive up to Murud (20 minutes by car) for a rustic beach experience. The fishing boats across the creek from Mahua Bagh make interesting subjects for photography and in the stillness of the night; one can hear engines of fishing boats juddering out to sea to set out their nets. There is no TV and both the internet and mobile connectivity are dodgy. This works splendidly well if you are looking for a truly disconnected break and we did a lot of reading in the beautiful open verandahs or slung in the hammocks; since there isn’t much else to do. The electricity situation was well under control and we managed to keep our phones and tabs charged. The staff; particularly Michael; Sudeep and the manager Sheval Jain take special care to cater to all requests and the three super friendly dogs Gypsy; Jimmy and Jack kept us company. If you are looking for a property that is literally away from the madding crowd; this is it! We've rated this as 'very good' for the absolute tranquility and home style comfort; which this place offered.,via Web,Jan-14,with family,3,3,4,3,3,4,WBKL,"Mumbai, India",4,4,4,8,NA,Room Tip: Room number 3; 4 or 5 are among the newer rooms on the ground level and are better maintained.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r189307111-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“A very pleasant atmosphere! Nothing was too much trouble”,5,11-12-2013,11/12/2013,Mahua Bagh is a very interesting property it belongs to a very famous Bollywood Actor how use to live in this property but and has now decided to rent out it out as holiday rental. There are 4 very big private villas with have fantastic views...over the rolling hills with lots of mango trees. We actually decided to stay in the new cottage block built 3 yrs ago (there is a conference area; along with a total of 4/5 seperate cottages) We enjoyed relaxing on the balcony outside our cottage... the kids enjoyed playing on the swinging chair so did i! We also made friends with the two dogs that sleep in the shade of the balcony. My favourite part about Mahua Bagh was it was full of surprises we had lovely Diwali fireworks the kids even had a go at lighting the fireworks which were they thorughly enjoyed!!!! I think what made Mahua Bagh a great location was down to the staff in particular the Manager/Chef/staff we thought you were exceptional.... nothing was too much trouble very helpful indeed. The Manager would ask us everyday if we would like any prefered food for our evening meal ie fresh pomfret...everytime we returned from a trip one of the staff would ask if we would like any fresh snacks cooked and brought over to the balcony along with drinks for the kids. The manager and staff we also so helpful in directing us to the right place to go on our trips;;; and too beaches. I think without the fantastic staff there wouldnt be such a great atmosphere at Mahua Bagh and the staff seemed happy in their work!. I particually liked the outside dinning area alongside a very nice hammock placed amongst the shady trees my only concern is that i have three kids and there was only one hammock;;;; it was quite amusing to see three kids squashed in the hammock like peas in a pod!!! we are looking forward to returning again for the next Diwali break and thanks the staff for making this the most memorable enjoyable trip one we wont forget :) thanks everyone,via Web,Nov-13,with family,5,4,5,3,3,5,Samantha T,"Pune, India",2,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r184439273-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Gem indeed....”,5,11-09-2013,11/09/2013,If you have GPS reaching the place is easy; however it's only the case with Mapmyindia. Google maps will leave you stranded. Entry to the resort is a difficult drive but once there it's a beauty in itself. Lush green lawns spread with interspersed palm gives a warm welcome. The two dogs especially the great dane offer you another angle to happiness... The food is so home made and fresh and tasty and so congenially served. We reached pretty late as were delayed during the travel; but the gesture of the manager to call us up and confirm our lunch was quite warm...not to mention that had our lunch around 3:30pm. The morning walk through the forest with someone guiding us (the great dane) gave us such a comfort. The beach was so close which gave us easy access at our times..but was always guided with the limited people around.. Rooms were excellent and hats off to the service provided...homely and very happy..but sad as we missed the cottages right by the forest due to the monsoons...will visit many more times...,via Web,Sep-13,with friends,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Muxep9ee,Vashi,2,NA,2,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r184154429-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“A Hidden Gem !!”,4,8/30/2013,8/30/2013,Mahua bagh is a tucked away property ... A little hard to find as they don't really have too many sign boards. The road leading to the property was actually no road indeed. Once we crossed the stone road and entered the property it was just breathtaking... A beautiful location covered with millions of mango trees and 4 rooms right at the entrance. They also have some other rooms a little further away; but due to the rains they were not functional.We stayed in one of the rooms right close to the entrance. The room was a pretty room though not very well maintained (moist walls). The washroom clean and big; with an open shower... Loved the way the rooms are constructed. You can see a million fireflies in the night which is good sight... Service: Brilliant!! The warmth of the staff and always eager to help attitude was amazing.. The service is very personal and every guest is treated well.Food: Home cooked; fresh and simply yummy ... The food is freshly cooked and served with warm chappatis at the time you want ...

Ofcourse it didnt have AC throughout the day; ofcourse sometimes it took some time for our requests to be catered to; but ofcourse it provided it peace and tranquility.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Mahua Bagh yet again!!”,5,05-08-2012,05/08/2012,This was my second stay at Mahua Bagh; the first was as part of the Natural History Society on a trip to Phansad. And it was an event to do with birding which got me to the park but it was the idea of a stay at Mahua Bagh again that had definitely has something to do with it as well! And to be there in a mango orchard; in the mango season sounded perfect!! It is a very comfortable stay and the rooms are cool; clean and spacious. Huge sliding doors and windows give a beautiful view. Having a separate room as dresser for all the bags and equipment keeps the room clutter free. The food too is amazing but still homely. We got to have mango in various form and perpetration. A sweet/spicey mango chuttney was just super. The chef is really excellent and the idea of using seasonal and locally available foods is refreshingly fresh!!It is a beautiful lush green orchard fairly large and very natural which adds to its beauty. In fact there could be very interesting walks and picnic spots in the orchard. We were told that there was a naturalist there on weekends who knows the area well and would accompany guests to the park or even in the property and tell about the natural flora and fona and bird life around - something which is much needed for the city dwellers!! I could hear the jungle foul when there and could also make out about the nocturnal visit of the wild boar in their organic vegetable patch.

Mahua Bagh Resort Kashid,“Spacious; homely and peaceful”,4,3/28/2012,3/28/2012,When our carefully crafted plan for a weekend family-getaway to Diveagar went haywire at the very last minute (literally!); we turned to Mahua Bagh and boy did we love it there! I had heard about Mahua Bagh straight from the horse's mouth; the owners Mr. and Mrs. Singh; during my stay at their Mahua Vann property at Pench National park earlier this year. They described it as a quaint little Mango Orchard nestled amidst the Nandgaon hills on one side and the mighty Arabian Sea on the other. True to their words; I found this place simple yet amazing.The property is situated about 13kms from the oh-so-popular Kashid beach. When driving from North i.e. Kashid to Murud; watch out for roadside signs for Mahua Bagh. When you arrive at the T (rather a K) junction roughly 4kms after crossing Nandgaon village; take the road which looks more beaten up (yes I have tried them both and yes it was a real pain both times). About 1.5kms of bumpy ride and you will be at Mahua Bagh; not at all friendly to your eco-sensitive Prius. The property is divided into 2 clusters of suites. The newer cluster has about 3-4 suites equipped with modern amenities whereas the old one has 6 larger rooms built in a cascading fashion and with an ethnic finish. I was there with my family (8 people right from the age of 3 to 63) and were put up in the older rooms. The rooms are spacious; painted white from inside and the upholstry matches the theme. There are parts where their age becomes obvious though (like bath fittings; noisy extra bed and withered drapes to name a few) These rooms have a direct access to the two levels of lawn and plantation (the newer rooms don't). Lunch; dinner and breakfast is served on this lawn in a buffet. You can relax on the vintage chairs in the lawn or go for a stroll along the mango plantation. My favorite place was the sit-out under the foliage right at the top of the cascade of the rooms which gives you a great view of the property. And the stairs leading to it is a great place for a family portrait. For those travelling with kids; the hammocks and the pet dogs will surely keep the kids occupied. To sum it up; Mahua Bagh is like a home we all dream of. It has a perfect blend of nature and luxury; and is a perfect backdrop for those long lasting memories. And remember; its a farm living experience i.e. simple living. Don't expect extravagant luxury for your money.,via Web,Mar-12,with family,3,5,3,4,4,4,ChetanBais,"Pune, India",7,6,6,1,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g1162187-d2468193-r126845818-Mahua_Bagh_Resort-Murud_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

The rooms were quite spacious and clean. It had complementary mineral water & tea maker.Returning from work; we had some snacks in their restaurant on the other side of the sideway. Before returning to our rooms; we went to a children's play area and healthcare zone where they have a fish spa. This was quite unique for a small town like Rourkela.For dinner; we went to another restaurant of the hotel serving mainly snacks. To our pleasant surprise; we found a large variety of dosa.

Radhika Regency Rourkela,“Great Hotel in Rourkela”,4,12/23/2012,12/23/2012,The first thing when we noticed as we got off the train and outside the station was that the Radhika Regency had a small glass room for its guests at the station.That was really something and we really loved the whole concept even the place was just 5 mins from the station. The basement packing is a bit weird with a Maruti 800 bursting out of the wall and a different range of guns painted on the pillar made me think what were they thinking. But even though the hotel is in the middle of the city i was pleasantly surprised by the silence inside the lobby and hotel in general. We stayed on the second floor and there was no view to speak of the room was spotless. We loved the fact that the room was extremely clean. Bathrooms huge with both hot and cold water and again clean.But we hated the fact that everytime we left and told the reception to get our room cleaned it never got done. Once we had to remind them 4 times that our room needs cleaning and they finally sent someone up to do that. And the second floor has a huge auditorium at the end of the hall which gets very loud at the day time and evenings. Not recommended. Now service is amazing and i have no complaints there. Every person from the staff refused tips at any given point of time and the 24 hour room service was top notch even at 2 in the night. Everyone including the drivers were very very conteous and made us feel at ease. The food is also very good and a wide variety as well. The bar on the other was very loud and not in the nice way. Very dingy and shady. Bartender very rude. We just had one drink and didnt like it at all. The manager at the bar was very helpful and we truly appreciate his attention towards keeping his guests happy. All in all a good experience with a few complaints which can be improved upon.

Unlike in the cases many good hotels; prices of food and drinks are quite reasonable  Secured arrangement of car parking in the ground floor of hotel-building and assured  accommodation for our car-driver at a very low price.One aspect that I did not like is that no staff of the hotel is allowed to accept any tips in spite of good service.Hopefully they are given excess salaries to make up for such losses.This hotel has one intrinsic drawback. Compared to its standards of service; it has insufficient land area. So; it has an unimpressive frontage and no back area at all.

My experience with Radhika:(i) Clean and hygienic room(ii) very friendly staff; and the manager as well (Mr Shahid Khan-we were traveling from Malaysia to Kolkata; took 6 hr train (a 'creepy' one) from Kolkata to Rourkela. Hotel staff were there to pick us up from train station at night without any extra charges (but just a short distance; about 200-300 m).(iii) doesn't implement custom of tipping-after they carried luggages to our rooms; I gave tip to a staff. He immediately rejected it and said it is not their practice here. I warned my other colleagues not to give any tips worrying that other staff might be waiting for tips. Eventually we found out all staff implement the honest attitude. Great!(iv) Food-delicious; worth the money; big portion; friendly waiters; clean environment(V) Sent us to conference venue everyday (about 10-15 min by car). Very disappointed with the organizer's poor arrangement. (v) On the last day; they sent us to train station and negotiated with some guys waiting to carry our big luggages to the opposite platform. Impossible to carry on our own. We felt the price was too low and willing to give extra money (poor workers there). Mr Shahid was smiling and got a headache at the same time (after bargaining for us; still we wanted to pay more). Life is difficult here; earning single cent is tough.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“The Queen of Panchgani”,4,11-03-2014,11/03/2014,I booked a vacation starting 1st Nov 2014-4th Nov 2014. Let me take u from the ground up .The website was very slow n erratic. The hotel should have a direct availability policy at the time of booking; They took the full payment but we were not sure whether we would get the place or no..again leaving our vacation in a limbo.But the best part was we got the room and the view from our room no 211 was amazing a 5/5..They have the best location...The check in was a smooth affair nd the coincerge staff was helpful with our luggage too..The rooms are well appointed..but signs of ageing are well seen..The rooms could have a mini fridge; nd the towels could smell aromatic...THE ROOM SERVICE FOR LUNCH N DINNER is not available except starters n soups..This is very annoying as to after a whole days sightseeing I didn't have the strength to visit the restaurant. but no choice. The restaurant is very thinly staffed..Just 1 capt to take d orders in a whole of the melting pot..it took us 25 mins to get the attention of the waiter to order our dinner.The food is good..could be improved however.The continental kitchen is closed..so missed out on that. The gym is fantastic but could do with more lighting.. Didn't use the other facilities like swimming pool etc..so cannot comment on the same..THE view ing deck is fantastic so are the tennis courts n the child play area.Overall a good stay.THE house keeping staff is excellent & very helpful indeed.. Overall I will still recommend this place...don't look at the lacunaes if you are a ardent nature fan....,via mobile,Nov-14,NA,4,5,NA,4,3,3,aleson1,"Mumbai, India",2,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r237771594-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Experience good ... but cant say the same about booking and billing”,4,10/29/2014,10/29/2014,"Let me start my review with two events that did not go down well with me1. I wanted to book a \Valley Plus\"" room for three nights. Before booking; I called up the reservations and they told me that Valley Plus was booked out; and Valley Side rooms were available. I booked the same on the web site immediately. At night; another person called me saying that Valley Side rooms are not available and wanted me to shift to East Side room. I referred to the discussion earlier in the day basis which i had booked. During discussion; he slipped that the Valley Side room was not available for all three nights. So I asked which night it was not available. He said the third night it was not available. So i booked valley plus for two nights and east side for the third night. While checkout; I was told that rooms are booked two months in advance .. .at the same time the person next to him was noting a booking for the next week. 2. During checkout; my bill showed AC usage. I had specifically booked for non-AC rooms. The lady at the reception told me that the room had AC fitted and the remote was in the room. So that means; AC was used. I told her that my family stays in Mumbai where temperatures rarely drop below 24 and the Panchgani temp was in the range of 14 to 18. So we are not even using the fans and there was not question of using the AC. Finally; they \""reluctantly\"" agreed to cancel the AC charges. Apart from the above two event; the stay was very pleasant and comforting. The hotel is located at the start of Panchgani. It is far from the city center and market; but that is also a boon as there is less noise more space around. The tennis courts are good. The play area for kids are well maintained. One of the rare occasions where I found that the play areas was clean and all items well maintained and in working conditions. The game zone in the basement is also good with a TT table; table football; carrom; pool table; air hockey. couple of items are charged per game but most are free. The gym is well equipped... though i did not use it but just had a peek. The in house restaurant serves good food. Barring a couple of personnel; the others are very helpful and pleasing to serve. We learned which tables to keep away so we can avoid the rude guys. They also have a mini-theatre; but we could not use it since there was a Devrai art exhibition going on in the same room .The rooms are spacious and clean. Overall a good experience and would definitely stay here again. A TIP: Check if AC remote in room. If it is there; do return to the reception to avoid point 2 situation described above.""",via Web,Oct-14,with family,NA,NA,NA,5,4,5,michaeldsilva,mumbai,71,20,22,4,1,Room Tip: Choose Valley Side or Valley Plus.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r236859161-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Ravine Hotel Satara,“Superb view from the Room..Service..Huh..Could have been better.”,4,10/28/2014,10/28/2014,We booked a valley view plus room and stayed in this hotel for 2 days. As I mentioned; the location of this hotel is too good; one can enjoy a beautiful view from the room. Room size is good enough for two people. The interior of the room was pretty good; which made the stay pleasant and relaxing. We did not try the swimming pool as it was cold in December; but the pool was neatly maintained. However; it was very small for such a big hotel. Now; let me put the facts straight:1. The hotel meets expectations if you are going with your spouse/family as you will get privacy to spend good quality time.2. The food is very good. If you are non-vegetarian; then you must try crispy chicken.3. Amenities such as table tennis and carrom are available free of cost whereas you will have to pay a little amount for using the billiards table.Cons:1. The staff is courteous but very very lazy when it comes to service (Service in this hotel is pathetic).2. I am not really convinced on the price I paid to stay in this hotel; I found his little expensive vis. a vis. the facilities and services they provided.3. There was no one to receive us at the reception and we had to request the hotel for picking our luggage from the car (ideally this should have been taken care by the hotel without even asking)4. The booking system is a bit traditional. They do not have tie up with many leading websites for room booking as we had to deposit the full amount in their account to confirm the booking. The credit card booking application does not seem to be much secure.My tips to the travellers:1. Go for Valley view plus or Executive room only.2. Try food (especially dinner) at any restaurant in Panchgani market; Most of the restaurant serves good food (try Chinese food as I found it better then the desi food)3. Buy fresh vegetables such as broccoli and carrots from Panchgani market as it is cheap and organic.4. If you are going towards Mahabaleshwar; then don’t buy strawberries from there as you will get good strawberries from Panchgani at a much cheaper rate.5. Carry warm clothes as it is always cold there.I will keep this hotel as an option and suggest it to my friends and family. However; I have heard that there are some other good hotels as well. Will try those as well.,via Web,Jan-14,as a couple,4,NA,NA,5,NA,2,deepak1821,"Mumbai, India",8,4,5,8,NA,Room Tip: Go for Valley view plus or Executive room only.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r236788932-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Royal stay at reasonable prices!!”,5,10/25/2014,10/25/2014,The moment you enter Panchgani; via Wai you get to see the sight of Ravine's property and its wonderful location.It is situated very close to Sydney Point and hence during your stay here you will get to witness breathtaking view of Krishna river valley from its premises. Although A valley facing room will be cherry on the cake; its land facing rooms also wont be much less!! Rooms are quite luxurious and give you a feel of royal ambiance with its interiors. It has a A-la-carte restaurant which serves some authentic parsi;mughlai style food. Although the service you get in here is extremely poor as the restaurant is quite understaffed and its very difficult for them to cope up even when only half of the tables are occupied. It is really disappointing to see especially when they charge you a handsome amount of service charge.So for food you can just drive/walk to the Panchgani market area which is around 1 km away.The staff is really courteous. We were provided a flexibility of extending our checkout by an hour Other facilities like spa;salon;tennis court make your stay quite relaxing and enjoyable. Although swimming pool can be improved if it can be temperature controlled and cleaned regularly.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“This place never disappoints!”,5,10/24/2014,10/24/2014,We had a last minute plan to go to Mahabaleshwar so I called up Ravine to see if I could get a room booked. I was informed that I could get reservations on walk-in since it was a lull period for the hotel. Oh; did I mention that I went in the 'off-season' so got a discount of 50%? The staff here is very pleasant and speaks good English; good training shows here. The hotel itself is very tastefully done and has a quaint look and feel. Everything in Ravine spells grandeur. It is very well-maintained and hotel staff is there at your beck and call. Food is relatively cheap (I live in Pune and am used to paying a minimum of 1500 for a meal of 4) and is tasty. All attractions in Mahabaleshwar can be covered from here in one go - max of 6-8 hours although I would recommend this place more for just staying back; getting lost in the grand valley that overlooks the hotel and lounging all day. There's a good spa (though I didn't have time to use it); tennis court and swimming pool here too.This is definitely my Mahabaleshwar stay for years to come.,via Web,Oct-14,with family,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,Rachna P,,1,NA,NA,2,2,Room Tip: If you're travelling in a group of four or more; you must opt for the ground floor premium room...,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r236029436-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Wonderful weekend getaway”,4,09-08-2014,09/08/2014,The main USP of Ravine is its location. Breathtaking vistas of the valley and the meandering lake can be seen from the Valley Plus rooms overlooking Sydney Point. Food is a-la-carte. They do not have a buffet option which is probably the only downside from my point of view as the a-la-carte options are definitely priced on the higher side. Quality of food is good and staff is very courteous and polite. The Spa is also quite good and a good option to de-stress.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Go for the view!”,5,8/22/2014,8/22/2014,Best place to stay in Panchgani for the view of the valley. Clean rooms.Helpful staff.Well maintained property.Stayed here in June & the weather was a pleasant escape from the Mumbai summer.Like other guests the reservation process & the front reception has room for improvement.Otherwise best choice for a 'peace of mind' vacation in Panchgani.You don't have any other option of a better property in Panchgani other than Keys Evershine in Mahabaleshwar; where we stayed for 2 nights after 3 nights @ The Ravine.,via mobile,Jun-14,NA,4,5,NA,5,4,5,Gee2415,,6,6,6,1,1,NA,Dear GuestThank you for choosing Ravine for your recent stay in Panchgani.We are glad that you consider our property at a good location & appreciating the beautiful valley and various activities.We are overwhelmed by your overall positive response!

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Room with awesome view”,4,8/20/2014,8/20/2014,Location; Location ; Location Ravine Hotel wins on all three counts!The view is amazing we stayed in corner jr executive room which has two glass walls one facing the valley and another facing Sydney point. The mists and river view played hide n seek with each other on one side and the other side had a view of Sydney point which was entertaining . At night we could see lights of vehicles travelling from Sydney point and in the daytime people jogging uphill .The best part was that the room had absolutely no smell of dampness which is prevalent in all hotels in Mahabaleshwar during monsoons ;we have spent quite a few monsoon vacations in Mahabaleshwar .The glass walls were dirty and streaked with cement ( I think they were recently repaired) and the room was also not very clean;there was a broken down refrigerator in the room which was emitting bad odour. We checked in and got housekeeping to clean up and take away the offending fridge and clean up the glass and then had a fantastic time. Housekeeping was responsive ; but you had to ask.The sofa and chairs had cloth covers which were sticky from constant use ;we asked for extra bedsheet and towels and covered them up. There was one complimentary bottle of mineral water on arrival; generally this class of hotels give one or two bottles everyday .Only basic channels were available on the TV . Hot water was always available .The jr executive room also had hairdryer and tea kettle.The food in both restaurant and room service was very good . Restaurant is very crowded with tables close to each other . The room service would deliver uncovered food ; request to hotel is to send covered trays. Room service was on even at 6 am which is great for early risers even though it was supposed to be from 7 am and hill stations are notoriously late risers. Bonus points for proximity to Rasoi Food ville which is a couple of minutes away and serves excellent Gujarati Thali.The wifi worked only in the lobby so we had to come out to the lobby to use it.The first morning we woke up to sunrise .mists and a beautiful vertical rainbow shooting straight down into the river !Definitely recommended for people who love grand views and open spaces .,via Web,Aug-14,as a couple,4,NA,NA,4,NA,4,mumbaisds,"Mumbai, India",35,16,16,1,1,Room Tip: the corner jr executive rooms have two walls as large picture windows so you get both valeey view an...,Dear Guest;Many thanks for sharing experience on your recent stay with us at.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Ravine in Rains”,4,08-12-2014,08/12/2014,We stayed for 4 nights at Ravine. August-4th to 8th . We stayed in valley view rooms which offered a great view of the valley The rooms are average on cleanliness; bathrooms are average. The rooms lack basic amenities like an electric kettle and a fridge...which I guess a three star should provide. The children's play area is very good and my kids enjoyed there. . Overall I would say don't expect too much; however you can really enjoy the view and the hotel is worth for its location.The location of the resort is excellent.We had booked 4 rooms but the hotel could not provide connected or consecutive rooms; we had to stay separated. No room service after 11.00PM was surprising as we were denied milk for small children accompanying us.

Due to the delayed monsoons this time; we could enjoy the property with a wonderful climate. Overall; i found the hotel worthwhile to visit.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“My second home during the monsoons”,4,08-04-2014,08/04/2014,I will be making my third annual monsoon trip to Panchgani this month; just for Ravine (and those delicious jams and preserves). I just love how Ravine is located away from the buzz of Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar; and situated at a very scenic spot (right next to Sydney point); so you can enjoy a great view even before stepping out of the premises. It’s a great break from the chaos of Lonavala (which you will know too well if you’re a Mumbaikar); and has some of the views of Khandala (although nothing compares to the view from Duke’s).It is a cozy; well-maintained and charming place to stay. The food is costly; but gets a 3.5/5 on deliciousness... They make the most amazing naan! Plus; for those who really want it; there’s a spa. I haven’t been there myself; so no comments on that. They’ve got loads of courts; for basketball; tennis and badminton; so if you’re planning an active trip; you’re in luck. My husband and I chill out in their courtyard with tea/coffee watching the sun set behind the hills every evening we are there. So; all in all; the property and stay are wonderful.Having said that; I too have experienced slack service from the management. It’s like they’ve decided to be on vacation too. For instance; on our last trip which lasted 3 days we had requested the car to be cleaned every day. It was cleaned once. I’ve experienced delayed room service in 2012 (over an hr of delay); but it was quite prompt last year. During the busy seasons; expect them to come half an hr later even if all you call for is a jug of water. If you’re not touchy about these things (and I am not because I go there to laze around and relax); it should be a pleasant trip.,via Web,Sep-13,as a couple,NA,5,NA,NA,5,3,Mitali S,"Mumbai, India",2,NA,2,1,NA,Room Tip: Valley plus is your best bet for a great view... when you do have a choice!

Ravine Hotel Satara,“I keep coming back to this place atleast once a year”,4,7/25/2014,7/25/2014,Ravine has been one of my favorite properties to revisit. I simply like visiting panchgani only to stay with Ravine. They are located in the right place; less than a km away from the market close to the hghway with a beautiful view and variety of activities. This hotel has elegant rooms and all that one requires for holiday. I like spending time watching stars on the cliff terrace. All the sports available and the mini sized pool that barely lets you swim but have that private time with your family or friends. They have a very good spa where one can take a blissful massage and rejuventae oneself also the products in the spa are very good to buy.All in all one of my best hotels that i keep revisiting everytime and it is never enough.,via Web,Aug-13,with friends,NA,NA,NA,4,4,4,Samata2k,Mumbai,25,16,18,3,NA,Room Tip: Valley plus rooms,Dear GuestThank you for choosing Ravine as always for your stay in Panchgani.We are glad that you consider our property at a good location & appreciating the beautiful valley and various activities.We are overwhelmed by your overall positive response!

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Spacious rooms with lovely views”,4,7/19/2014,7/19/2014,We stayed here for three nights earlier this week. It rained a lot and the view from the valley side room was pretty breathtaking. When the rains slowed down or when it was less misty; one could see the beautiful Western Ghats and the Krishna river from the hotel room. I had spend quite a number of hours sitting by the large glass window; reading and enjoying the view.The rooms are equipped with standard amenities; but I was a little surprised that they didn't have an electric kettle and tea/coffee condiments. Bathrooms are clean and have hot water all day long. Housekeeping and room dining services were really prompt and good. My only disappointment was the dining area: fancy and lovely views; but the whole area smelled funny. I had asked the staff about it but they didn't seem to care much. My diagnosis of the smell is that the tables are not cleared out immediately after people leave. Everytime we saw left-over food lying on adjacent tables that are waiting to be cleared. And with the rains (which adds to the dampness of the place); not clearing out tables is clearly not helping the situation. I thought this was slightly unprofessional for a luxury hotel. Food was pretty okay (not awesome) and the staff were careful about our dietary requests. Though way more expensive than other restaurants in the area.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“terrible experience”,2,6/27/2014,6/27/2014,Although the tariff hike is justifiable; the ever-rising magnitude of arrogance is just unnecessary.

We were 5 families. We went to this hotel to enquire abt room availability. Since the rooms were small and swimming pool was not maintained properly; we decided not to go for this hotel. Since we all were hungry including our childern ; we checked with the restaurant in the hotel if we could have lunch there. Waiter over there told us that we can have lunch .We placed the order for the food and waited for almost 25 mins. After 25 mins we were told that since we are not hotel guests we can not have lunch in the restaurant. After waiting for 25 mins we and our children had to leave the hotel empty stomach.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Breathtaking experience!”,4,06-06-2014,06/06/2014,Stayed here during the onset of monsoons. One of the most amazing places to stay in Panchgani. The winner was the tennis court which is right at the top of the hill. The restaurant is not that great in terms of of the overall experience. It is understaffed and thus resulting in a poor service. Another factor that puts one off is the frugality of the management. The rooms are par above excellence but I find it hard to digest that our room did not have a ceiling fan and we had to manage with a table fan! Unfortunately; Panchgani was not at its coolest. All in all; a good experience; value for money and stay here for the brilliant view that the hotel offers.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Excellent view.. Amazing location”,4,06-02-2014,06/02/2014,Imagine you go to a hill station and there is a famous 'point' to see the beauty of the town; and at the tip of this point is your resort and you get that room which looks over the valley with river; won't it be fun. Ravine Hotel is just that hotel. The view from the rooms towers over every problem you will encounter during your stay. A very decent property near Sydney point is something which you would love. In fact I checked out several other hotels/resorts in Panchgani and none came near this as far as location was concerned. Even the restaurant has a beautiful view so that you can just sit relax and eat your food. Staff of the hotel is helpful but I think they need more training to handle sophisticated travelers. If I have to summarise our stay; these are the points:Pros:Very nice view from your room [you should ask for valley looking rooms]Nicely decorated rooms Nice amenities like tennis court; pool; snooker; swimming; spa etc.Polite staff Cons:Swimming pool was very dirty all the times; they should take care of itreception at the hotel wasn't that great; they could be more politeBed has to be firm and it wasn't comfortable for me for sureDon't know but once you walk towards your room from the lift to any floor; there is some stench smell comes..couldn't find what was that but wasn't very pleasant.But I guess; once you are in the room; you will forget everything cause the view is really breathtaking and you just want to soak in the environment.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Nice could be better”,3,05-12-2014,05/12/2014,"Ravine is a nice property but could be better. A bit confused with this hotel's booking policy- we booked a ground floor premium room (has a mezz floor with a bed/bath) which can easily accommodate 4 adults (we were 2 adults and 2 children (10 yrs and 13yrs)...we had to pay & take one additional bed for some reason. When I inquired with front desk; they mentioned we charge for the kids anyway - well; if you are booking based on the room and not charging for individuals; neither are you providing any extra bed NOR providing any food what's the logic for charging ? Like I said; weird.Only this room has a nice sit out; you can step out and sit in the verandha to enjoy but strangely this was also closed and not opened on request. They claimed; they have closed access from room since last 8 months but no logical answer was provided why so. They mentioned it was due to rats and insects; but they could enter from the open windows as well since it was the ground floor. Would have been a great experience if they had opened this sitout access. The ground floor premium room is best of the lot. You get a view of the mountains from the mezz floor and tennis courts from the ground floor. The valley view rooms are also good and have a great view of the valley; would recommend either one of these rooms depending on group size. Sydney point is right next to the resort and a great place for viewing sunsets.The pool is rather small and usable for kids; adults can just relax but cant swim. They have a play area in the basement with foos ball; table tennis; pool table; carroms...the pool table is chargeable but reasonable cost; rest free. The restaurant has a great view to the valley. In all the three days we were there; there was just two people to take orders and serve...one of the nights it was pretty crowded and we wondered how they would manage. Weekends are usually crowded here. There's no package with food included. Food was good but quite expensive. Couple of bread slices cost 35 rupees....they charge this even with omelettes. With limited manpower; it may make sense to provide buffet services. They have a Spa but didnt get a chance to use it. Saw the spa services menu and it looks quite comprehensive. They charge extra for the AC though the rooms when booked are with AC included. If the rooms are booked with AC included; what's the point in showing it separately in the bill? Maybe it's a good idea for those who dont use it and reduce their bill but it's not made clear when booking. Weird again.Like I said; this resort is nice but with some more \friendliness\"" & \""customer engagement\"" thrown in; could possibly become one of the best resorts in the area.""",via Web,May-14,with family,3,4,3,4,3,4,murlinambiar,Bombay,9,7,7,1,1,Room Tip: Ground floor premium room and valley view rooms are best.,Dear Reviewer;Many thanks for sharing your experience.We value the feedback of our guests; and we appreciate your overall good review about our property!We have taken into account a few of the short comings pointed out by you and will take steps to ensure that you don’t face issues like the ones mentioned.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“pathetic services with nothing to do in hotel”,1,05-01-2014,05/01/2014,Travelling is my hobby and I write about every hotel i visit for my travel. Ravine is unnecessary hype and maybe preferred by people because its the only 2-3 star hotel in panchgani so its kind of monopoly for them. However just 20 kms or 15 mins away is mahabaleshwar which gives immense options of good resports at much cheaper rate and excellent services so i will always recommend people to stay in mahabaleshwar and never at ravine if they dont want to waste money & are looking for good experienceTurn on for hotels 1) Food: The quality and taste of food is excellent however you loose the excitement if waiters dont listen to you and food arrives after one hour2) Spa: The spa services are excellent with well trained staff and amazing ambience and doesnt cost much.Turn off for hotels:1) Rooms: all rooms are differently designed; some big some small etc so you will be lucky enough to get big room otherwise you will feel dissatisfied seeing someone else libving in big room at same price. Valley side view has no view of valley but of the garden in the hotel(i think why its name valleyside and not gardenside). AC will not be working most of the times; TV will have only few channels playing with some or the other error; towels will not be replaced even if you call room serice infinite number of times2) Pool: Pool is a big disappointment. Its only 4 feet deep and so small that if 10 people get into it then even if you move your arm be sure you are going to hit someone. No services are available at pool side may it be food or towels. The pool is in small area and closed from all sides except top so you dont feel much relaxed in such hussle bussle3) Staff: The staff will treat you as if they gave you room in charity and you have to take it in the condition it is. Everytime you visit the reception area; you will see one or the other guest fighting with staff for one or the other issue which is very uncommon even in 2 star hotels. Restaurant has only 2 waiters for seating capacity of over 100 people which means waiter can entertain your order only once in 20-30 mins. Staff tried to cheat us by giving a foam sheet to be used as bed giving the reason hotel is full whereas in reality many rooms were empty. When I argued over same they replaced with a proper extra bed4) Indoor games: Indoor games are on basement in a completely non-maintained area. I would have not imagined a concept of hotel where indoor games are on basement without fans or AC. TT bats are broken; no tools available to play air hockey or european football. The only thing which you could play is snooker which is only 6-10pm that too if you can stand the heat of basement without ac or fan5) Location: Its at the starting of panchgani not near to any tourist attraction or market. There is no grocery or medical shop nearby so you have to take your car 4 km to the market for anything you need. Mahabaleshwar tourist locations are very farI would suggest people not to go by the good reviews written by the travellers as they would have found it good because they would have visited only panchgani(& not mahabaleshwar) where Ravine is the only option. Mahabaleshwar has much better options at much cheaper rates. ravine equivalent hotel in mahabaleshwar will cost you Rs. 2000 only with better services,via Web,Apr-14,with family,1,2,1,3,3,1,gaurav n,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",5,5,5,1,5,Room Tip: Only executive rooms have valley view,Dear Guest;Many thanks for sharing your experience.We value the feedback of our guests; and we appreciate your overall good review about our property!We have thoroughly reviewed your feedback and feel that we owe you our deepest apologies for the inconvenience that you faced.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good Hotel but can be better”,4,4/28/2014,4/28/2014,My husband heard about this hotel from one of his colleagues. Many film stars also visit this hotel. So we also planned to stay here. Our stay at this hotel was somewhat good and bad too. Good part is that the ambiance of the hotel is good; rooms are spacious enough and best is their room service. Now the bad part; we reached the hotel early so the guy at the reception asked us to wait for an hour. So we waited; but even after 1 hour the room was not ready. We almost waited 1hour 45mins to get the room. When we entered the room; it was smelling bad. Toilets were not cleaned properly; bedsheets was stained! When we asked for room freshener; the guy came with floor mop and with scented floor cleanser. We asked him is there no room freshener? He said we don't have one. They took 1.45mins and did not clean the room properly. I mean such a big hotel with film stars coming to this hotel and such poor maintenance. If you go to restaurant you sit there for 10-15mins and no waiter will come and asks you for order. So room service is best. Also to mention their food is good too.I felt probably if i were a film star i would have been greeted well; my room would have extra clean and I guess rooms would have been available whenever i walked in. In all not a very satisfactory stay; but an okay types stay. I will not visit again.,via Web,Feb-14,as a couple,3,4,4,3,2,3,Adventures-around,"Pune, India",24,14,15,1,4,Room Tip: Select valley facing rooms.

Though the hotel doesn't provide any special arrangements for birthdays(confirmed by reception staff) the view from the room and the entire property made my day special. Here are the positives and negatives of the Hotel and roomPositive1.Valley plus rooms have awesome view2.The entire resort property is well designed and one can spend time sitting in the premises itself3.Food is tasty4.Reception staff was polite. Negatives1.Restaurant staff have different behavior towards in house guest and outside guests once they know you are in house guest their tone of voice changes ;;its strange but true.2.Food is tasty but very costly 3.They dont serve main course in the room only snacks and starters are available for room service4.There is no doorbell for rooms and the room service staff knocks the door so badly it becomes annoying sometimes. overall I would rate this hotel 7/10 for view and the property.,via Web,Apr-14,as a couple,4,5,5,5,5,4,taps20,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",23,9,12,3,2,Room Tip: Valley Plus rooms have amazing view,Dear Reviewer;Many thanks for sharing your experience.We value the feedback of our guests; and we appreciate your overall good review about our property!We have taken into account a few of the short comings pointed out by you and will take steps to ensure that you don’t face issues like the ones mentioned.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Amazing View”,4,04-12-2014,04/12/2014,The biggest plus for this hotel is the amazing view that this hotel provides. It is awesome (if you take the valley view premium rooms). I would have rated this hotel higher if I would have found the service better. When we reached after a travel from Mumbai; the restaurant staff seemed rather indifferent to serve. In fact we had to wait for some time before they even cleared the tables for us to sit. That despite; the fact that we had to repeatedly tell them to do so. Granted; we were late; but the attitude of the serving staff was quite cold. That put us off a bit. Though; later during the stay; we did find couple of guys like Kartik and another person; (my apologies for missing out his name; he is from Manipur); who were quite pleasant and seemed quite happy to serve. The hotel has tennis courts/ a basket ball court; so that is quite good if you want to chill out in the hotel itself. In the view there is a common deck for you to sit and enjoy the view of the stars. Food is decent. Did not go to the pool or the spa so cannot comment on the same. Housekeeping and Room service were fast. But yes; the rooms and utilities could do with a lot more refurbishments and upgrade.,via Web,Mar-14,with family,3,5,4,3,4,3,manmohan_menon,mumbai,6,6,6,2,NA,Room Tip: Choose either the valley view or the Executive room.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great but ..”,4,04-07-2014,04/07/2014,The hotel is situated at an amazing place. The staff at the reception were efficient and helpful. Now to the rooms which are nice and clean however; the english comode seems to be a bit high especially for children. There was a bit of a plumbing issue also which was quickly sorted out. The swimming pool was in need of a good cleaning and after a dip in the rather dirty pool we did not want to risk going to the jacuzzi which i think was not working. The observation deck is amazing at sunset perhaps some tea with some snacks there would have made it even more enjoyable but i guess seeing a sun set in its brilliance .. awesome.Breakfast was nice but the service was slow and there was some blotting paper in the curds which we ordered (some quality check needed there as it seems it is something done by many to get a good consistency of curds).If i do go back .. and i will .. it will be for the observation desk especially to see yet another spectacular sunset and a good relaxing massage at the spa.,via Web,Apr-14,with family,4,5,4,4,4,4,Dominic D,Mumbai,38,21,21,2,1,NA,Dear Reviewer;Many thanks for sharing your experience.We value the feedback of our guests; and we appreciate your overall good review about our property!We have taken into account a few of the short comings pointed out by you and will take steps to ensure that you don’t face issues like the ones mentioned.

The lady at the reception was extremely unfriendly; as if I had done a mistake in choosing the hotel. Since I had paid in advance for a suite room; I had been constantly asking(on phone before the check-in date) if I can choose a room and was continuously refused - can't figure out the reason why. When I checked in; this lady just handed over the keys to me; when I asked if there was any option available - she just replied \that's the only room available\"" in a manner - take it or leave it. Incidentally; this was the worst room available I believe - the fridge was stinking; the bed was so soft that if you sit in the corner you will fall down (be ready for a body ache in the morning after a night's sleep); the so called bath tub has a shower panel which was leaking from all sides; you would have to spend an hour to fill water in it due to a pathetic water flow. The room service was pathetic; you have to shout at them to get your room cleaned. The owner and management staff seems to be least bothered about anything happening in the hotel.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Not what it use to be”,2,02-11-2014,02/11/2014,I stayed 3nights last week and was disappointed with what the hotel has turned to as compared to my previous stay since 1999. 1. They have expanded the number of rooms; this has directly influenced the quietness. The corridors are always so noisy and very difficult to get some peaceful sleep. Infact; the valley view plus room for which they charge a premium is bang opposite the sundries room and you would always hear hotel staff conversing and with thin doors it was really annoying.2. The first day I checked in I spend time just getting things fixed; the TV did not work; the shower had no pressure and was chocked; the wash basin had similar problems; there was a persistent could smell in the room.3. They have an additional elevated parking and I can't understand why chauffeur driven cars can't be asked to use this parking and save the one outside the main entrance for self driven cars which makes it so much more convenient for people who drive themselves and move the bags.4. As you first drive in most probably chances are that you would end up driving into the parking and not the hotel entrance. They is no clear sign board that directs you down the slope into the hotel. Most people who first drove in were lost driving into elevated parking area.5. They have a star gazing guy which is great but he operates on a parking slot bang opposite the hotel entrance which is at a premium for guests (considering the hotel owners use few more for their ATVs etc). Cant understand why the star gazing can't happen from the elevated parking are which is usually not busy and offers a clearer view.6. When asked for a universal adaptor; they did not have one. I am sure they have international guests who at some point may need an adaptor and surprised to know thaw did not have any.7. Modern looking shower consoles in the bathroom but not practical. The water pressure is terrible and the amount of water that flows through is not sufficient for a good shower after a long day.8. The booking system is unbelievably traditional. If you called from Mumbai directly to the hotel; you are re-directed to an office in Mumbai who would first ask for your mobile number fro them to call back even before they confirm availability and costs (??). You need to call several time before they mail you the confirmation.I use to love Ravine but following the last week stay; I would never stay here again; its no longer the same.,via Web,Feb-14,as a couple,3,4,1,2,3,4,Chetan68,"Mumbai, India",17,10,12,1,1,NA,Dear GuestThank you for your review.Trip Advisor is a fantastic tool for our guests to objectively criticize the Hotel; to enable us to improve.I apologize that your experience was below par; that you felt the need to leave such a poor review. We all try so hard and are mortified when we receive any negative reviews.I am sorry to read that you were disturbed by other guests during your stay. I can assure you that regular patrols are carried out on a daily basis by our Night Porter; to ensure any disturbance is kept to a minimum. This is an issue which is not easily controlled but if you had only let us known; we would have immediately rectified the situation; I can assure you this is not a common occurrence.However; we have many different types of room so it is always worth asking to move if something is not quite right and we are keen to ensure guests are comfortable during their stay.I have noted your feedback and will be reviewing it with the relevant departments in the hotel. Our team at Ravine takes great pride in looking after our guests and as such we are disappointed that on this occasion; our high standard of service was not met. Your review does not mention whether you discussed your disappointment prior to your departure however I would welcome the opportunity to do so if you could please contact me directly at the hotel.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Decent Hotel”,3,02-03-2014,02/03/2014,This is a nice hotel. Clean rooms / bathrooms; linen etc. So much so that there is an overpowering smell of phenyl in the restaurant. The view from the valley plus rooms is fantastic. Staff is generally cheerful and helpful. Would have given it a fourth star had it not been for the horrible room reservation experience.Another thing to keep in mind is that this is the first hotel in Panchgini when you climb up the ghat from Wai which puts it in one end of the Panchgani / Mahabaleshwar hill station.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great place to stay in Panchgani”,4,02-03-2014,02/03/2014,I stayed here for 2 nights with family in Jan 2014. The location is great - not too far from the town (you need to have your own vehicle though) and at the same time; very quiet and peaceful a place to live at. This is located just after you pay the toll fees to enter panchgani; and about 3 kms from the Mapro farm; which is further up on the mahabaleswar road. The rooms (I took the super deluxe ones) overlook the valley; and the view from the window is breathtaking. The rooms are clean and spacious; with all basic amenities. The hotel also has good facilities such as a tennis court; some indoor entertainment etc. The layout of the hotel is nice; with little hidden gems in the property like an artificial waterfall; provisions to have a bonfire etc; which rounds off the overall staying experience. The only improvement I can think of is making the food menu a little more widespread; and try cutting down on the oil levels; which were a tad higher than what I would expect.

The view from the Valley View Plus rooms is really soothing and refreshing. We generally make it a point to visit every year as the view of the Krishna river and the valley is breathtaking. The food is really good but slightly expensive. The rooms are neat;clean and well done up especially in the new wing. Room service is also decent. There are 4 tennis courts and a viewing deck used for party purposes. The Serenity spa is also great.This hotel scores over other hotels in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani for purely location.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Best View in Panchgani”,4,01-02-2014,01/02/2014,We had the pleasure to stay in Valley Plus rooms at Hotel Ravine during Christmas! The hotel is at a unique location just at the start of Panchgani. When we entered our room; we were awestruck by the magnificent view of the valley and the Krishna river.The room was clean and well maintained. We had a laugh when we looked at the safe deposit locker. It wasn't attached to anything and a thief could easily walk away with the entire locker.The food at the restaurant was excellent; even though it was expensive; the quantity was sufficient. The service was surprisingly good as well.The hotel is equipped with 4 tennis courts; a small swimming pool; kiddie play area; a games room and an open air restaurant. The play area for kids is really nice and our kid did enjoy his time out there...The most annoying experience about this hotel was the presence of a lot of house flies everywhere on the hotel premises; even at the kiddie play areas. It was kind of eerie and felt very unhygienic. We had never seen so many even at other locations in Panchgani. I think the hotel management should seriously take note of this issue and do something about it.,via Web,Dec-13,with family,4,5,2,4,4,4,FalconVision,Mumbai,36,10,10,4,2,Room Tip: Valley plus rooms are absolutely worth it.,Dear Reviewer;Thank you for staying with us at Ravine and for your absolutely amazing review.We are delighted to read that you all thoroughly enjoyed your holiday especially recreational activities.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good - X mas party”,3,12/26/2013,12/26/2013,We had checked in the hotel on Dec 24 for 2 nights and 2 rooms. The hotel is good value for money. Rooms are neat and housekeeping staff is good. They can do better with the beds as they have springs in it which can be annoying at times. Overall the view is excellent and the food is good.I must say the service in the hotel restaurant is not great as there are few waiters which are running around to cater to the exisiting order....we waited for 10 mins in the morning and no one even bother to clear the tables or take orders...went to the market nearby to have the breakfast.Overall its a recommend and probably I can go again but they should sincerly look at enahncing the customer satisfaction...there is no feedback form taken or even asked for bit surprising.....I know this is peak season but a bit more curteous behaviour and small things can really enhance the experience.One more disappointment was we categorically asked if Santa would be around in the party on Dec 25 and were told yes of course..but kids were bit disappointed on not seeing one in the evening !!Overall I would give 3 stars and if there was couple of improvements probably 5 stars in next visit !!,via Web,Dec-13,with family,3,5,2,4,4,2,Himcal,"Pune, India",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dear Guest;We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay and thank you for your positive comments; with regards to the neat rooms and housekeeping staff.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“View gardens Tennis is all this hotel offer”,4,12/19/2013,12/19/2013,The first big thing when you enter Panchgani is Ravine. It is one of the biggest hotel on the main highway. The USP of this place is its locations bang on the Highway . Have stayed lot of time in this property for one simple reason location and accessibility.Other then this it is a basics simple hotel which offers very good rooms with basics amenities which are not renovated from ages.There is a very good play area for kids of all ages which I havent seen in any hotels of that category. There are plenty of tennis court with scenic view of the valley and river.The swimming pool is there but not there . As it is very small and fit only for a dip.Some suggestions for the hotel:--You have the best location in Mahableshwar PanchanganiIF you add some feature like a game room and maybe add a heated swimmming pool you would be one star above all.Food can be improved with little more varieties.IF you have noticed as a regular who have stayed at ravine; people use your place as lodging more then enjoying everythin in house.,via Web,Oct-13,with family,5,5,5,4,4,3,Azharalin,Mumbai,4,4,4,7,NA,NA,Dear Reviewer;Thank you for taking the time to leave your positive feedback following your recent stay at Ravine.We have noted your comments regarding refurbishment & will pass this on to the management.At Ravine we are always working on improving all aspects of Hospitality and your comments will definitely be seriously considered.

Beds are comfortable They have rooms that overlook the valley; excellent view (Ask for vallye view rooms ) . Upkeep of property is just about ok. A lot more can be done to make it better. They have a few tennis court ; you may see some good games also happening. They have a great place for a sit out overlooking the valley and river. From here you can see the sun set behind the mountaints..Its an excellent view and you can spend atleast an hour just sitting there. They also have a kids play area; where small kids will have a great time for sure.. The entire hotel has a DG backup for power failure situations;; so that's not a worry. That is where the best part ends. The restaurant they have creates a very bad experience. Bad is an understatement. They serve al - a - carte and many items have a good 30 minute wait. This is the first restaurant where you walk in for breakfast and the first thing they tell you; please raise your full breakfast requirement at once; we will take some time to serve. Even breakfast items have a 30 minute wait Whew!!! .They know how to spoil your mood in the morning. The quality of what they serve is also not great.. You can seriously seriosuly give a pass to their restaurant; if You have a vehicle go out and eat.. Dont bother to eat here... The restaurant pricing is at par with what you would pay at other 3/4 Star Hotels .. The rest of the experience is great...

Located at the Sydney point; it is just next tJro the Panchgani toll and conveniently located. We had made advance reservations online about a month before our visit; as we heard the hotel is often overbooked.The experience in Jr. Executive room was amazing mainly because of the stunning views and a rustic vintage decor. The only problem with full open glass windows is a little loss of privacy; but who cares when you can wake up to such a beautiful view! We had booked 220 which is at the end and hence have two side open views. However; coming to the flip side I don't understand why the bathing area is so unbelievably small?

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Loved the hotel but not the hidden charges”,4,10/14/2013,10/14/2013,There is very little to not like about the property. Fab location; well-appointed rooms and suite; loads of things to keep the kids busy with and very attentive staff. The food was also quite good. Our only grouse was the steep tax - 17 per cent. They take you through the tariff structure; telling you how they are giving you a 30 per cent discount and then say you have to pay a 17 per cent tax. Besides; the tariff they charge you on paper for AC rooms is actually not what is printed on paper. They tell you that IF you switch on the AC; you have to pay 1200 bucks more. C'mon!

We would like to clarify there are No Hidden Charges charged from our end; those are the Govt taxes which are mandatory for which proper bills are been provided; due to frequently changing Tax rates and regulations the taxes are accounted separately.

Secondly as we are pure veggies the smell in the restaurant was not welcoming.2. the restaurant serves south indian food for a limited time; but i suggest that they should serve it all day as it was brilliant.3. the spa was a total rip off for us. i and my wife did a back massage and both of us experienced severe pain on our back on the next day. so i would suggest better avoid the spa here.rest everything was upto the mark. would definitely stay at this hotel whenever i am back in panchgini.,via Web,Sep-13,as a couple,4,5,5,3,3,4,SamAsia123,"MUMBAI,INDIA",120,66,51,9,NA,Room Tip: Choose the valley plus rooms for best views. rooms on 2nd floor give better views.,Dear Guest;We thank you for your detailed review about our property & also appreciate the overall rating given by you!

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Greaaat place.”,4,08-11-2013,08/11/2013,Let me just start by saying that the location of this hotel is spot on and the views that it commands of the valley is mesmerizing. The place is windy every time of the day. I'd recommend you visit only for the view only. The Hotel is well maintained and great too. The rooms with the views of the valleys are the best. Service is great and quick. Food is delicious though repetitive. Rooms have all the amenities and well kept and are not particularly luxurious but great nonetheless. There is a swimming pool too but it was not well maintained; so that was a dissapointment. Wifi is not completely free and is too slow. Sydney point is located just at 10 minutes walk from the hotel and has amazing views.

The hotel is nice 3 star kind of. Service is quick; staff are professional. Food quality is very good however bit expensive. Atleast they should reduce the price of Tea. Otherwise every thing perfect. Location bit far from market 1.5 km but that's fine. Also hotel view itself is a point so you can have a nice view from hotel only.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Nice property; but had to fight for the room we paid for.”,2,7/28/2013,7/28/2013,This would have easily been a 4 rating but for one fact. Although we had booked the junior exec room; we were initially given the second bedroom of the executive room. Although the room itself is very cozy; the door to the adjoining room is not at all sound proof. We would easily her the family next to us; even though they were talking in normal tones. Furthermore this being the second bedroom does not have all the amenities of the main one. We realised the problem when the lights went out; and we found out that it was because the people next door had removed their key card when they left the room. If only the management had clearly let us know all this before we had to argue it out.They did give us the room we had asked for late at night. The room unfortunately was not prepared; and it was nearly 12 am by the time it was all ready. This ruining what would have been a perfect holiday.I still give it 2 stars ( since there is no 2.5) because of the service and the food from room service. The view from the room as expected was great. Note that this is one of the windiest places I have been to. The whistling and howling of the wind at night is enough to keep one awake. Tata sky in the room was a bonus. The spa was also good; although a bit overpriced.There is ample parking; well equipped gym; pool; game room and tennis courts. Overall this is actually a very well equipped property with great views. Some of the rooms could be refurbished. If not for the fact that we did not get the room we paid for up front; I rate this lowly. That being said I would love to come back here again; just worried that I may not get what is committed.,via mobile,Jul-13,as a couple,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Shayne P,Mumbai,31,20,19,2,NA,NA,Dear Guest;Many thanks for sharing your experience.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Beautiful Resort & Scenic Location”,4,7/24/2013,7/24/2013,We stayed in Ravine for 3 days as a couple from 16th July. The resort is very well maintained and has amazingly beautiful view of the valley. Location: The location is the best part of the resort; situated right next to the Sydney point; it offers an amazing view of the valley and Krishna river. Surrounded with mountains and and clouds you are left mesmerized with the natural beauty that the place offers.Rooms: We stayed in the Jr executive room (220). The room was beautiful and spacious. It offered an excellent view of the valley form the front window and a nice view of Sydney point from the side window. The windows were full wall sized windows so the view was amazing. Due to very heavy rainfall there was little water leaking through the windows which was taken care by the staff by blocking it with towels. We would recommend this room for the excellent double-sided view it has to offer.Food: At ravine they do not have any complimentary breakfast or tea; neither do the have meal packages; which is quite disappointing as all major hotels nowadays offer meal packages. Anyways; we had all our meals at the restaurant and we liked it. The food tasted good and the quantity was also good. The prices are reasonable; neither too high nor is it cheap. The service at the restaurant is what was amazing; wonderful staff and you're always served with a smile.Service: The staff at the reception is professional and friendly; the staff at the restaurant is amazing. The room service on the other hand was not up to the mark; was terrible slow in one case when we had to call up 4 times for them to change linen and clean up the room. It was off-season so they don't have a lot of staff working at this time of the year.Cab Service:The hotel has a tie-up with cab service provider 'Amol' . We had booked their cab for sightseeing as well as for pickup drop from Pune. The service is terrible; the guy just changed plans on his own misguided us on a number of occasions. This was the only reason we give this resort 4 star otherwise it definitely deserves a 5 star.Value for money: The resort in the off-season on weekdays is a steal. Even on weekends it is quite cheap. They charge extra for the A/C which is fine. But if they offered buffet meal packages it would be amazing.

Called up the hotel to know if staying in Panchgani would be better then saying in Mahabaleshwarthe guy on the phone replied that he does not know about Mahabaleshwar.Booked it online as it seemed to be a good hotel. The hotel is located right next to panchgani toll gate. we opted for the valley side room and we were not disappointed ; The room offered excellent view of the valley.The room was fairly simple ; considering this is a budget hotel. But the huge window offering wonderful views was really a cherry on the cake.The hotel offers only snacks and beverages in room service. It seems that this is a family run hotel ; so the reception is not very efficient at times. The restaurant again has a nice view ; but very average food.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“The BEST Hotel in the BEST Budget”,5,6/21/2013,6/21/2013,It was our first wedding anniversary; therefore HAD to be special!!! And when it is Ravine... Nothing to worry about.We had a pre-booking and the entire amount was paid. While we were on our way to Panchgani; the hotel staff called to inform that the weather condition was bad and there was heavy rains; in case we wanted to cancel our booing! But we went ahead. Extremely well maintained. The hotel looks very good from outside. The rooms are excellent and this hotel has the best location in Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani. Rooms are very well maintained with spacious toilets. The room rates are worth the stay. The food is little expensive; but again worth the taste. They have an excellent spa and a theatre. The theatre can be booked at Rs200 per movie...so book the entire theatre and watch a movie cozily with your partner.We had booked Valley Plus room. However; since there were heavy rains; they had upgraded us to Superior rooms. We agreed to pay the extra rate of the room. However; when the bill came at the end of the trip; the extra rate was waived off completely! Also; a yumy cae was sent to our room on the day of our anniversary. It was on the house!Above all; this is the hotel where entire cast and crew of bollywood stays. The hotel is mostly booked by production units...so you can well understand the standards of the hotel. Infact; at the ground floor; there is one suite booked for Salman han. He always stays there. After my stay; I had suggested my friend to visit their; and you wont believe; opposite to her room stayed Shahrukh; deepika and rohit shetty...shooting Chennai Express!!Ravine is definitely a wannabe place with wonderful view; lovely service and great comfort.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Feedback on Hotel Ravine @ Panchgani - a Miserly and Incumbent 3 star hotel”,1,06-05-2013,06/05/2013,I am writing this feedback out of frustration from the experience that I had with Hotel Ravine @ Panchgani. After reviews from various sites; I got conflicting reviews on the Hotel. But then I decided to book deceipt by the online site and the images.  The online booking was done within a few minutes but even after 3 days I did not get any confirmation from them. I finally started calling them day after day; 8 times. But. Did not get any confirmation. It is only after threatening them with taking them to the court;I finally received the confirmation. Finally when we landed in the hotel expecting that the experience should be better than the booking experience. But we were in for a surprise; it started with the Travel desk. There was no-one at the travel desk and we had to wait for 30 minutes and still could not find anyone. After that the struggle started for getting the WiFi connection. I was given the User ID and Password; which got my wireless started; but it wa short lived. When enquired they told me that the wireless is complimentary only for the first hour and then it is chargeable. This was again something I could not digest; we stayed in a Non Star hotel but had 24*7  wireless free. An this was a 3 start property which did not have wireless free. I would have been fine with is but the checkin brochure that ideas given at the time of checkin did not have any such details. It was a diktat by the manager which had to be followed without any questions. On fighting and taking them to task I was given an alms of 2 hours of free Internet.There is more; the restaurant is exorbitantly overpriced; there is only on person taking the order and serving too and the quantity is anybody's guess.I wanted to write this so as to give the correct picture of my experience and to warn other users about the same. BE CAUTIOUS before you book your holidays here. Horrible experience!!!!!,via Web,Jun-13,with family,1,4,1,3,1,1,Hardy_Boy71,"Solapur, India",1,NA,NA,4,4,NA,Dear Guest;We have thoroughly reviewed your feedback and feel that we owe you our deepest apologies for the inconvenience that you faced.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Stunned with the location - facilities were below average”,4,06-04-2013,06/04/2013,I had been to Ravine hotel last September with my husband to celebrate marraige anniversary. I had done this booking without consulting husband. I was little skeptical over it since I have never visited this place. Location : The hotel is located at the beginning of Panchgani via Wai. So easily traceable. Just after you are stopped to collect the tourist tax. Sydney point is just besides this hotel.Room : I had booked Valley facing room. As soon as we entered - I was stunned to see the view from our huge window. Amazing pic from room :). River dividing the mountains around. The tranquility - what I felt was splendid! Room had nice wooden furniture. I felt the bathing section was little smaller in size. Since it was cooler and raining; hot water was another problem. We kept on following up with room service for hot water. At early morning hours; I saw whole big orange colored Moon. Stunning experience that will be vivid.Food : We went during the last day of Ganpati immersion hence the hotel was running short of staff. So first day - food serving was slow. Besides this day; the food serving was good. Food is good; tasty. No meal plans exists.Staff : We had checked-in 2 hrs late; so we asked a favor to check-out 1hr late. But staff was stern to say No. Though a kind Manager; Mr. Rathod apologized on staff's behalf later on. General staff was kind and helpful.Spa : The Spa experience was great. Stress reliever; hygienic; neat and good staff.Considering the hotel location I would rate between Average and Very Good.,via Web,Sep-12,as a couple,4,5,4,4,4,3,Mumbai_27_Traveller,Mumbai,7,4,5,2,NA,Room Tip: Prefer Valley facing rooms.Do visit the spa.,Dear Guest;Thank you for taking the time to review the Ravine Hotel.I am glad you found the hotel clean and you liked the location.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good Location”,4,5/31/2013,5/31/2013,This Hotel is located on Entry Point of Panchgani; where government collects Tourism Tax for Panchgani. Hotel is on Sydney Point. Very good rear side of Hotel View. It has 4 Tennis Courts; so if you love playing then please carry required gears. But charges are 150 INR per Half an hour. This hotel is away from Main Market around 2 Kms; so personnel vehicle is must. Hotel has got Small Swimming Pool with poor change room facility; Best Gym; Indoor Games like Carom; TT; Chess; chargeable Table Hockey @ 20 INR per game; and some other coin based games....Food is very good in Hotel but there is no inclusive of food plan.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Amazing location but average hospitality”,3,5/31/2013,5/31/2013,We called the hotel to book our room but the person who answered was very rude and blunt. So; we called the booking office in Mumbai and our booking was done by Mr. Bharat who was very helpful and spoke very courteously unlike his counterpart from Panchgani. We wanted to book a Ground Floor Premium room but it was not available; so we opted for the Ground floor room. These rooms can accommodate a family of four. After driving down from Pune; we wanted to check in as soon as possible but they made us wait for ONE WHOLE HOUR. The ground floor room has absolutely no view except of the parking lot. The room was dimly lit and not very spacious. The room had absolutely no ventilation and it was suffocating. The bathroom was separated from the toilet and it was very inconvenient for the morning ablutions. The TV was really old and one could watch only limited channels. They do not offer complimentary breakfast which is very odd considering the high tariff. These days even budget hotels offer a tea/coffee maker; a newspaper; free Wi Fi; mineral water etc. but that is NOT the case with Hotel Ravine. They boast about the Bollywood stars that have stayed with them during a film shoot etc. but I guess it’s only the stars that get the 5 star pampering; the other guests have to fend for themselves. Since there was no ventilation; we opted to use the AC after paying an extra Rs.600/- (NOT inclusive of the room tariff of Rs. 5000/-) but it wouldn't work and they took hours to repair it. Finally; they replaced it with an AC from another room. We just had to bear with all the inconvenience.After two days & nights of torture; we shifted to the Ground Floor Premium Room which was like a breath of fresh air; compared to the previous room. It was well ventilated and there was no need for the AC; as strong cool winds blew from across the valley. The interiors of the room were good and it was very spacious with a very good view. The room service was good and so was the food. The swimming pool was dirty and a foul smell emanated from that area. Since; it is the only 3 star hotel in Panchgani; with an awesome view of the valley; the management is using it to their advantage.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good weekend getaway from Pune and Mumbai”,4,5/17/2013,5/17/2013,I had been there in early may 2013. It was a last minute booking that I did directly by making an online payment on their website. Please account for 2-3 days for the confirmation of the booking to come by. On reaching the reception I was cordially welcomed with a soft drink. Teh check in process was smooth and quick. I had booked a Valley Plus room with them. The room was pleasant and had a great view of the valley beyond. The room has a big glass window as one of the walls overlooking the valley. Though i had gone there pre monsoon time; I would think it would be a great view in the rains with the hills lush green. It was not bad either as of now.The food service in the restaurant was a bit slow though cant complain since it has a great view of the valley. Unfortunately; I think the food quality has dropped a lot. In my previous visits to their restautant i simply loved the food there. But not this time around. Its a good idea to order for food in the room too.The hotel has a very good ambience with lots of facilities - pool; children play area; Lawn tennis courts (4 of them); SPA; etc.One thing that I didnt quite like were the huts that they so marvel as their USP. Somehow I felt they were not that well mantained. Also during nights it seemed that the approach to the huts were not well lit - this could be by design since people would want to have privacy. The Birds eye one was a total No No. It was scary to qualify - though i visited in the afternoon; i couldnt imagine how folks would be there in the evenings; etc. Pretty secluded place at that.Otherwise if the idea is to have some bit of fun with children; I would think its an ideal place.,via Web,May-13,with family,3,5,5,5,4,3,AshishPune,Pune,9,3,6,6,NA,Room Tip: Valley plus rooms were good.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Pathetic customer service”,1,05-09-2013,05/09/2013,"The pictures and reviews seemed favourable however; I was utterly disappointed by the callous and uncouth customer service. These guys probably need to start by understanding what hospitality means! The reception (or whoever attends the enquiries) have no clue of what the booking position is. I had called up the hotel desk to enquire about availability and I was assured the same. They insisted on online booking which at best an outdated system which charges the money upfront without any confirmation of availability. If the person running the desk doesn't have clue; what else one can expect of the system. Garbage in garbage out! After charging the money the system promises to send a confirmation within 24 hrs. After the payment; I again called up the desk who repeated the same message. Such is the inefficient system that even after 48 hrs letter there was not any response. When I called up again; one Mr Bahadur (yes I asked the name this time which I know through bitter experience one must everytime you call up this place) for a change accepted that he has no clue what he is doing at front desk. But in his brilliant sense of humour he says that the customer knows who's has a booking why do I need to know. He says that the only hope I have is certain all mighty \Mr Rathod\"" (rowdy aptly). I managed to get an audience with this sample after 72 hrs after they took money from me. He rudely informs that there are no rooms for my booking. When I told him about confirmations from front desk he asks me name of the person. As if by knowing the name by some magic new rooms would open up. So lesson for anyone looking to book: ask the name of the person you speak to else that idiot will potentially ruin your holiday. After three calls to Mr \""rowdy\"" Rathod; he says the cancellation mail has been sent as if he has done a big favour to me. I am now truely impressed with \""Google's intelligence (which is definitely higher than the Ravine staff) cause it directed that email to its right place \""SPAM\"". I dont know when these idiots will refund my money. The whole attitude of the so called manager and staff is unfit for being into hospitality business.

However; when you keep the windows it brings in lovely winds inside which refresh you immediately. The other side has an amazing view of the valley and the hotel is located at the foot of Sydney point. The only issue was the hotel did not allow food inside the rooms.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“improvement the logical form of change!”,4,04-05-2013,04/05/2013,this is my hotel of choice when in Panchgani for location location and space. This was our second visit and though the experience was at par with the last; there is a lot of scope for improvement. Firtsly i think the management truly needs to freshen up the hotel; its rooms and amenities provided. (Wondering what the rooms where the big stars stay look like) . The spa is at par with many five star spas in Mumbai. The staff sometimes gets too bogged down by the stars which they cater to and ignore the rest ; but still they do a good job. The restraunt serves good food. But there are options like Jaffer Bhai's ; Lucky Cafe and Starwberry Inn. But the staff at the restraunt is really attentive . The childrens park is excellent. The flora and fauna well kempt . The star gazing through a 1000 mm telescope in the night with a local person (dont remember his name) who is so enthusiactic about the space is a must do. Truly would like to see some change in the overall ambeinec of the hotel next time i visist and visit i surely will !

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Major improvement required”,3,04-02-2013,04/02/2013,"I had been to Ravine for the last 3 days. It's a hotel that is at a very good location. They have nice little rooms overlooking the valley and it is a pleasant sight when you wake up. The stay was not one of the best ones but maybe I would rate them at 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the best.This hotel must have been a very good hotel in its prime but now I feel it is just a shadow of what it must have been earlier. The food; though expensive is just \OK\""; though when you have a Jaffer bhai's Delhi Durbar just around the corner who will eat here. They had those normal problems that you have with a poorly managed hotels; for e.g. problematic flush that works only when twisted in a peculiar style; lots of used bed sheets; towels kept in the corridor etc. Hardly any attention to detail ;for e.g as I had my son with me and an extra bed was required and though informed well in advance; we had to call them to set it up; extra bathroom accessories were not kept etc. I was there when SRK; Deepika and Rohit Shetty were also staying here and so obviously the focus was more towards them. I was surprised that they were giving super attention to one junior extra - (normally acts as a dark monster in films and gets bashed up by the hero every now and then). While at the breakfast table no one even came to take up the order while all the waiters and other staff were busy clicking picture with this monster and I had to leave the hotel and have breakfast some place else.It might be slightly better if there are no film actors around. Please confirm before going.The best place in the hotel was their Spa. It was a very nice experience and me and my wife really enjoyed it. I recommend you try it once.""",via Web,Mar-13,with family,3,5,3,4,3,3,Creativegene,"Mumbai, India",23,11,13,1,3,NA,Dear Guest;Thank you for your positive review and recommending our Hotel.

There are very few options to eat out near the hotel and the restaurant is quite overpriced. Another problem is there is no room service for serving food in the rooms and one has to go down even for having a cup of tea.

Name it and you will get the best you can think of.Chose this hotel through the reviews on Trip Advisor and glad that i have chosen this hotel.Pros: Chosen Valley Plus Room (Was offered for 1st floor;i insisted on the second floor; was lucky that it was available). The View is just the way shown on the Site (Check out the Photos).The Service is prompt.The Staff was very cooperative. ( Had read a lot about the behaviour of certain staff in the other reviews; i didnt come across any such person).The Food @ Melting Pot is Good. (Charges on higher side!)Tennis Court; Game Zone; Play Area; Garden; Gymnasium etc available.Spa Service is Excellent.Ample Parking Space.Improvements Required.1. Tea / Coffee Maker in the Room.2. Refrigerator in the room.3. Bath Tub.4. Unlucky to find the Jaccuzzi and Swimming Pool not for Use.Though the above are add ons; and can be overlooked for the rest of the services offered.Do visit the following places during your stay @ Panchgani:1. Mapro Garden - Visit in the Morning - Before 10 am to avoid rush and to enjoy the fresh Strawberrys.Strawberry and Ice Cream is the Best Serving Here. Dont miss it !2. Amusement Park; there are couple of them: Visited On Wheelz; Good Place for Kids to enjoy.3. Boat Ride @ Krishna River - Wai - Dont Miss it ! Visit early Morning or early Evening.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Perfect destination to relax among the winds...”,4,1/30/2013,1/30/2013,Had been to this tranquil place as a part of our 1st anniversary celebration. Thank you Tripadvisor for your honest reviews. As mentioned by fellow reviewers; the location just wins over everything else. Service was superb right from booking till check-out. We were at Room No.209 (Valley Plus).The serenity spa is worth visiting with it's various treatments (though everything mentioned on their list was not available as the particular staff was not present). Secondly; the Melting Pot Restaurant is awesome with the quality and taste of food (though it is a bit on the expensive side). The do have small Swimming pool; Gym & Games room (they charge for games except TT & Carrom). The Art gallery on top floor is worth noticable.The only problem we had was due to the renovation work. The continuous noise of drilling throughout the day which disturbed the otherwise peacefull afternoon & it did'nt stop even after requesting to the reception twice.

My fav one is the eagle's cabin which has a barbeque spot n the best view of the valley. A tent for four is also available for the family. Its best to check out their site for pictures and these pictures dont lie. In short its a great place to be at an affordable price and an amazing view.. well worth every penny.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Bulldozed for a VIP!”,1,12/27/2012,12/27/2012,Don't you just hate it when you are at a restaurant or a lounge and you get really shoddy service because everyone is engaged in entertaining a VIP/celebrity who happens to be there at the same time. 'Give him/her all the VIP treatment you want but please not at my expense'. Something similar occurred during our stay at Hotel Ravine.We were 2 couples and an infant and we stayed there for 3nights and 4days; our last night there happened to be the Christmas eve. SRK; DP & the production crew were staying at the hotel. The first few days were uneventful. However; on Christmas Eve; it all began. To start with; they cordoned off the entire garden/ kid's play area in the evening; saying that it has been reserved for their private party. That leaves you with very little option but to return to your rooms. We were planning to start early next morning to beat the city traffic (I was driving) on the way back. But then their private party started. Music which started at around 10pm went on till 2am in the night! (Even Goa shacks shut earlier) This was accompanied with a lot of 'karaoke' howling. (C'mon this is a family resort or so I thought). We called twice at the reception to atleast request them to tone it down; but with no luck. Then our friend's infant got cranky with all the noise and disturbed sleep and it turned out to be a very groggy Christmas morning and a tiring journey back for us. The next day when I wanted to convey my angst to the owner; I was told at the reception that he doesn't have time for such small things. Talk about hospitality business! (After a lot of insistence; I finally did get to speak to one of the owners. To his credit; he did apologize for it) Everything else about the stay was overshadowed by this...,via Web,Dec-12,as a couple,1,1,1,1,1,1,The_Meanderer,"Mumbai, India",9,9,9,2,9,NA,Dear Guest; unfortunately this was one of the times at the Ravine; that the good times “did” get out of hand; it was supposed to be a quiet get together for the Crew of Chennai Express to relax and enjoy Christmas together; unfortunately the crew did not end the entertainment at a decent hour. The management ensures that the hotel is a family venue and we don’t take issues like this lightly. It was brought to the owners attention and in future events like these will be planned carefully so that Our Main Stars “our guest” get what Ravine is known for “Good Service and Relaxation”.Warm RegardsGeetaRavine Hotel,31-Jan-13,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r148133733-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Ravine Hotel Satara,“Beautiful view. Disappointing restaurant.”,4,12/26/2012,12/26/2012,The view (photograph added) as mentioned repeatedly; is really great. Have stayed at Ravine many years back and it was nice to note that they have re-done all the rooms. Lovely stone+wood combination in the rooms. Super clean too.A special mention about the booking process..It was the long Christmas weekend and they have a policy of booking the room for a minimum of 2 rooms during such a time. But; noticing that we were returning visitors - they made an exception and allowed us to book for just 1 day.The hotel compound is spectacular. Apart from the regular rooms; they have wooden cabins perched in the valley below. They've built an artificial pond with sand which gives it a pretty cool feel. The pond needed to have been cleaned though; some guests were using it to dispose off packets of biscuits and wafers.The Spa is really great. The 'blissful back' massage was fantastic. Complete value for money.What was a major let down was their restaurant 'Melting Pot'. One of the main reasons for us to come back to the Ravine was their restaurant. This time around it was really really disappointing. It lost the cozy abode-in-the-hills feel about it and the new decor completely lacked character. The tables were rather huge and they are not meant for couples or groups of 2-3. The waiters had a disappointing attitude - almost as if they hated working there. None of them were smiling. The food too was not up to the standards we'd experienced before.If you love a leisurely game of Tennis; then Ravine is definitely the place for it. They have 4 tennis courts here! Tennis is/was a huge passion of the owners. Their sons player professional tennis. I wonder if they also have a Tennis club associated with the hotel.Note:WiFi - Available only in the lobby. Wish the rooms had WiFi connectivity too; as 3G (Vodafone at least) coverage is absent in the Panchgani/Mahabaleshwar area.To sum it up; a near perfect weekend getaway for people from Mumbai and Pune.,via Web,Dec-12,with family,3,4,4,4,4,3,EkalavyaB,,14,14,14,1,1,Room Tip: I don't know anyone who would want to stay at the Ravine and not want a room with a view of the...,Dear Guest; thank you for your ‘Marvelous’ review.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Worth the View!”,4,12-12-2012,12/12/2012,After a surprise dinner on my bday; my wife gifted me this surprise holiday at the Ravine. I must say this Resort is a real treat for the eyes and mind. Views from the room and the overall property are unparalleled. There are several different varieties of rooms on offer including tents. Tents look extremely comfortable but our pick was the room as it had better views. Try to get one on the 2nd floor & you ll be able to see the winding river completing a postcard picture scenery.Well being a 3 star hotel; it has its cons. The glass windows in the rooms should be cleaned regularly as it was the only thing that spoilt the fantastic view. Mattresses and some other upholstery were showing signs of age and should be replaced in the near future. We stayed in the Junior Executive Room which was recently done up; especially the bathroom; but even then the shower panel was not working smoothly.Meals are not included in the stay prices and food is on the expensive side; considering the taste & quality of the food. The kitchen staff does a good job of serving; for e.g. the Chicken Pahadi Tikka we ordered was served in a sizzler plate on a bed of caramalized onions; the taste was only above average.Nevertheless; I would give a big thumbs up for the staff & the hotel owners for being honest and upfront in all communication. When we were shown the tents; we were clearly told the pros & cons; time to serve food in the room was told on placing the order and it always came at least 10 minutes earlier than promised.Highly Recommended and worthy of my first review on TripAdvisor!

We had selected the valley plus room. The room was small but decent. The best part about the room was the large glass window facing the valley. The view is the only thing that makes the room worth the price. The restaurant also offers an excellent view of the valley. The food was good and service at the restaurant excellent. We had our 6 month old with us and the waiters at the restaurant did their best to make us comfortable. The hotel has its tennis courts; so for the tennis enthusiasts that is another plus point.One negative that I can think of - at the time of checkout; we called the reception 2-3 times asking them to send someone to the room to carry the luggage down.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good Property but terrible room reservation systems”,3,11/27/2012,11/27/2012,"We booked two rooms in Ravine; from 16th November 2012 to 19th November 2012; we did this booking through Hotel's website. After online payment through debit card we didn't receive any confirmation from the hotel or any kind of mail.. after 48 hours; when contacted the reservations; they took almost three days to send mail that they booked the rooms in our name and also mail didnt have proper confirmation details. So we contacted the Hotel and confirmed ; they said the printout of mail will work during check inn.I would like to mention two persons here who gave this confirmation but didnt respond during our check in at the Hotel.Mr. Barucha from Pune booking office and Mr. Aamir from reservations.When we checked in Hotel on Nov 16th; the reception personnel's said that our booking is not confirmed and they didnt recieve our payment.When we showed that email printout; they blindly said that it must have mailed erroneously as its just booking confirmation but not payment confirmation. We were shocked to hear that we did not make payment and during that time;We didn't had enough funds to pay them full amount for the stay Somehow with great efforts; we got the bank statement of debit card from the Bank manager( who in general cases does not give bank statements without passbooks) and showed them that we did payment long back. They checked their bank statements and found that we did payment almost a month back. The Response we got later was terrible and sily that \ due to some mistake in checking bank statement they could not confirm our payment\"".Due to this silly mistake of theirs we were in mental agony for almost 2 days and did not have any peace of mind which we required during holiday.We suggest to all future holiday planner to confirm the hotel booking; rooms; payments and other required things categorically before planning to head to The RAVINE.Other wise The Ravine is a very good property to stay with average service and pathetic systems.""",via Web,Nov-12,with family,3,4,3,3,3,3,Pankaj2012,"Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India",1,NA,NA,1,1,Room Tip: Valley side rooms!!,Dear Guest; firstly we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you during your stay with us.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Amazing place to sit back & relax”,4,11/14/2012,11/14/2012,The view from the hotel window is really very nice. You see Krishna River and its beautiful valley. You can also see Dhom Dam which is on this river. The room has a big glass window and a coffee table-chairs near it. You can relax and watch beautiful sun-set from your room.The hotel has a small natural landscaped garden. They also have tents where you can stay - but you cant use tent from June-October due to rains. It must be nice experience to stay in those tents overlooking valley. This time when we went to Panchagani- Mahabaleshwar; I was not sure if I will be able to walk and explore a lot due to my pregnancy. So I wanted a place where I can relax at hotel itself. It was a good choice. The hotel is around 30 kms from Mahabaleshwar and 5 kms from Panchagani. It's on main road. The hotel has 5 tennis courts; a spa and a restaurant. a couple of negative things - hopefully they will get rectified.. The food was with limited variety and not so great but OK. There are no much options nearby. When we were in hotel; there were some tennis matches going on and the players were put up in the same hotel. It was very noisy due to this and we were disturbed couple of times at night due to some boys staying in nearby rooms. It would have been better if the staff would have been more polite. We used to get blank calls due to some problem in their phone system. On complaining the staff was reluctant to do anything or even to say sorry about the trouble.,via Web,Oct-12,as a couple,4,5,3,4,4,3,AlpanaS,"Mumbai, India",15,5,9,9,1,Room Tip: Ask for Valley View Rooms - preferably on 2nd flr. 1st flr is also ok,Dear Guest; Thank you for your ‘Amazing’ review.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Locational Advantage for Ravine.”,4,11/14/2012,11/14/2012,Its not about Ravine. Its about Panchgani.A neat 3 hours drive from Pune landed me in Panchgani. And I am glad I chose Panchgani over the hyped Mahabaleshwar to stay overnight. Ravine was a natural choice having read so much about it; courtesy Trip Advisor forums. Situated near the Sydney Point; Hotel Ravine is set truly in nature's lap. We chose the Valley Plus room and the glass window opened up to the mesmerising beauty of nature. Yes; its Panchgani. Bliss.Ravine is a 3 star hotel and the facilities are adequate considering the remote location. The room seemed good for the price although the gigantic sized spider webs were not good for the eyes. Room Service Department- Are you listening ?The food at restaurant was good to taste but appeared overpriced. How I wish they included the breakfast in the room tariff ! The main turn off for me was that the Wi-Fi did not work from the room..the signal was only at the lobby level. The resort has multiple facilities- Tennis Courts; Spa; Kids zone etc. The hotel also provides car hire services for sight seeing through an outsourced travel desk and I availed it to my satisfaction. Overall; Ravine is a good place to stay. The hotel staff also appeared professional. With expectations limited; this is a treat for nature lovers.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Beautiful Destination”,4,11-08-2012,11/08/2012,Our stay at Ravine was made really memorable by the wonderful attitude and service offered by the manager-in-charge; Mr. Rathod. Right from the time I had booked online; to communicated via email with him till the time we decided to cut short our stay by a couple of days because of a sudden change in our plans...he was always a joy to interact with. The hotel is good with decent food and service offered. The lawns are a true joy. The only areas of improvement I can think of for this are that there should be breakfast included in the package and secondly; at such a scenic place; I missed having a balcony to sit and enjoy the beauty from.,via Web,Oct-12,with family,4,3,3,3,3,4,Mona_jain,"Hyderabad, India",7,7,7,6,1,Room Tip: We had stayed in the Valley View Plus room which had a great view of nature,Dear Guest; Thank you for your Positive review.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“More that what meets the eye.”,4,10/25/2012,10/25/2012,I recently visited Panchgani and stayed at this hotel.I would rate this hotel as 4/5 although they themselves claim to be of 3 star standard because it was a real value for money deal in the off season.The hotel boasts of a huge property beside Sydney Point in Panchgani and the calmness and the serenity is the main attraction here. We stayed in the Valley Facing rooms(214 & 215) which offer s spectacular view of the valley. The rooms are not very big but very cosy and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very promt with check-in and providing me with my requests at anytime during the day.The resturant packs some awsome meals but yes it comes at a price. The resturant may turn out to be costly but the food is good. The hotel has a 'On Request' movie theatre;a spa and a gym for indoor activities and it has a good tennis court for outdoor activities. The swimming pool was non functional when we went but i guess i wouldn't have used it anyway. Since the property is very big so there are parts which are not maintained well but the usableable parts are kept clean. The roof top over the side of the hotel near the cottages offers a grand view of the canyon and you can enjoy the setting sun from there. This hotel is meant for nature and peace lovers. So if you are looking for a break from the hustle and bustle of city life ;this is the place to be.I felt that the rule for online booking during weekends should be made more flexible. This Hotel(along with other hotels in the region) only allows 2 or more days of reservation during online booking for weekends. I guess they should also allow single day booking to give more flexibility to customers with short visit schedule.,via Web,Oct-12,with family,4,5,4,3,3,4,KunalPanja,"Pune, India",15,11,12,3,6,Room Tip: Rooms 209 to 215 are the best as they provide good view of the valley.,Dear Guest; Thank you for your ‘Splendid’ review. We are indeed; overwhelmed; with your response towards our service to you and would like to specially thank you for your recommendation to; not only visit Ravine; but to also explore the ravines of Panchgani. Also; it is because of the hush-rush during peak season; we do not take online booking just for 1 day for the Weekend. Although; you can book your room for 1 day by ‘Walking-in’ at the Hotel (if rooms are available).

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Terribly Managed;Fantastic Property and Location!!”,3,8/24/2012,8/24/2012,This was our second time at the Ravine and hence my second review about the property. We stayed here for two nights and had booked 4 rooms for Saturday and Sunday i.e 7th and the 8th of July. To start off with; we had booked 4 rooms so we obviously wanted them to be together or atleast close to each other especially since we had booked in advance(almost a week ago).But we had been unfortunately allotted 2 rooms on the first floor (121;122) and 2 on the second floor(203;204) which was kind of inconvenient. They have this strange policy of not discussing the room numbers at the time of booking and you get a standard and an almost robotic answer from their reservation staff( Rajni) saying ‘’ we will see what we can do’!! almost bordering on sounding rude. Talking about staff;as mentioned by some other people in their reviews; the less you interact with them; the better. They almost never have a smile on their face or look welcoming. Coming to the rooms; 3 of the four rooms allotted were alrite except room 204. The bed in this room deserves a special mention. The bed frame in this room is probably 2/3rd size(or less) of the mattress that had been placed on it ( in terms of width) making it very saggy when you sit on either side and you could almost fall off the bed while sitting or sleeping as there is no bed under the mattress on the sides!! A call to the reception and the housekeeping staff come up to ‘’investigate’’ almost not acknowledging the problem and seemed completely surprised that such a thing could happen ; which I found hard to believe. Spent the next 15 minutes trying to adjust the mattress towards the exact centre of the bed frame and supposedly thats all they could do at that point!! No apologies ; no offer to change the room...absolutely nothing!! Kindly avoid this room or atleast check the bed before you decide to take up this room.Checkout was uneventful except for the fact that we had to take the luggage downstairs ourselves as no staff showed up even after requesting twice .To sum it up; Ravine is a beautiful property with very very good location only spoilt by the people who are running it. Do not expect prompt service or a pleasant smile and you will be alrite.,via Web,Jul-12,with family,3,5,2,3,3,1,ace_sam_2000,"Navi Mumbai, India",12,10,10,1,2,NA,Dear Guest; Thank you for your feedback.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good experience.”,3,8/21/2012,8/21/2012,The best thing about the hotel is its location.

However; it is very unfortunate that the management is so poor that it spoils the entire experience of one's holiday !! From rude reservation staff to untrained front desk and housekeeping; it all forces one to believe that it was better to choose another property. Rajani; the reservations staff is very arrogant and unprofessional. They don't even send an email to confirm reservations and treat guests as if they are doing a favor by accepting a reservation. On reading other reviews; we realized that we were not the only one who came across such behavior. Even after sending a written complaint; they do not bother to revert. They are very disrespectful with their guests making them feel insulted !! There are much better properties in Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar where one can enjoy their holiday.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Superb Ambience and Great food”,4,6/27/2012,6/27/2012,One of the best hotels i have ever been in Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani. To start with; the location of the hotel is simply great and very easy to find. The Hotel has very good parking space and beautiful entrance lobby. We opted for the Valley facing rooms and as the name suggests...the rooms opened up into Deep Valley. Looks like the room is just on the edge of the valley and it was all greenary outside....the fanatastic view through the window gives you all the money's worth......We visited during the monsoons and the climate was terrific...It was all fog everywhere and the experience was great....The hotel has well maitained swimming pool but we didnt use since it was already cold.They have Jaccuzi but it was not operational at that time.There are two big lawn tennis courts behind the hotel and very well maintained club house. The Gym is very well equipped.The Hotel staff is very helpful. They have a mini theatre where they play movies on demand...So you can watch your favourite movie with your loved ones while getting a private theatre feeling.The food taste and variety is good and service is very fast. The only concern is that hotel is costly and it should be considering the amenties they provide. I would always recommend this hotel if you want a royal holiday feeling....For budget travellers; there are other cheaper options...,via Web,Aug-11,with friends,4,5,4,5,5,5,nash011286,Thane,30,11,11,3,2,Room Tip: always go for valley facing rooms,Thank you for the ‘Splendid’ review.

We liked the rooms; had an amazing view. They have an ac and non ac option ; charged 600 extra for the ac; don't like this at a time when all hotels have the ac option at no extra charge. Decided to go to the spa; got an instant appointment. The spa experience was amazing ;well trained therapists. Then we decided to go to the pool & were shocked to see was shut ; were really disappointed. That pool was one of the reasons for which we choose that place.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Amazing views!!!!!!! The USP”,3,06-11-2012,06/11/2012,We visited this hotel sometime around Aug2011.First of all booking is easy. Had pre-booked online. And locating the place is also very easy as it is the first one as you reach Panchgani. The views are amazing..the valley view rooms give u a spectacular view and u wud simply feel like lazing around the place. The spa is good..Some good massages (both AYurvedic and Thai). The food at the Melting pot restaurant is also good..They looked like short of staff though when the tables were full; but the existing people tried to cater to all the diners ! I wud say the view and the spa are the only good things from a hotel perspective. Food is good..not excellent. Swimming pool is small and not at all in a usable condition.

When I entered the hotel and met the receptionist; everything looked good. But when I experienced the hotel staff service; it was terrible; cheap and very embarrassing.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Fresh air on the sun deck is all i'd remember!”,3,5/25/2012,5/25/2012,We stayed @ Ravine from 21st-24th May & had the valley plus room with a breathtaking view of the mountains. Location is great. The room was undoubtedly lovely but lacked comfort. The master bed was too uncomfortable; the dunlop mattress was a nightmare to sleep on; if the other person moves the whole bed shakes. The extra single bed was so old that it made creaking sounds when i moved. We didn't get peaceful sleep for ALL 3 NIGHTS! The swimming pool is VERY SMALL & unfortunately the filtration system wasn't working; so we couldn't use it. The games room is nice; i enjoyed playing table tennis & the slot machines are useless; don't go for it. Tennis courts are good; but they charge Rs 150 for 30mins. Spa is too costly; not worth 1 bit. The sun deck is AMAZING; the fresh air & coolness of this place during peak summers was exhilarating. FOOD - VERY EXPENSIVE. I fell sick the 1st day after eating the food; it was tasty but very unhygienic due to all the flies. There are way too many flies around this hotel. Room service is good but the food was bad; we had to return it. All in all it was expensive but ok.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great experience”,5,5/24/2012,5/24/2012,Stayed at Hotel Ravine; Panchgani for two nights on 21st & 22nd May 2012. It was a very good experience. We all enjoyed the stay very much. Kids had a great time at the play area and game room. In a nutshell:1. The location is fantastic; and overlooks the valley. We didn't really even need the A/C although it was peak summer.2. The rooms were great; the ambience; cleanliness was great. 3. Room service was also great.4. The play area; game room; tennis courts - excellent.5. The only dissapointment was the swimming pool - it's very small; and unfortunately for us; the filteration system was not working; so we couldnt enjoy that.6. The staff is professional and courteous.7. The food was also very good - we had one dinner there.8. It's very peaceful - away from the maddening rush of the 'holiday' crowd during peak season!,via Web,May-12,with family,4,5,5,5,5,4,Nixdes,"Mumbai, India",1,NA,NA,5,5,NA,Thanks you for writing wonderful reviews about our hotel.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great Location;nice hotel;Bad management”,3,5/24/2012,5/24/2012,We stayed at the Ravine for 2 nights and had booked five rooms( not hillside view) as we were 5 couples on a short vacation from mumbai with kids aged 4. Let me start of with the bad part first.As mentioned in other reviews ; they do charge Rs600 extra for Airconditioning which i was completely unaware of until i requested for the Ac to be switched on.After agreeing to pay for it ; they said they will send someone over shortly to switch on the Ac.It took them forever to send some one to do the needful and when the staff finally arrived; he seemed to be carrying half a dozen AC remotes with him and didnt know which one worked with this particular Ac. Finally after trying each one; it turns out that none of them actually work and he somehow managed to open the front panel of the split unit and switched it on manually.With the Ac now switched on we were happy but only for a short while as the AC was set at 24-25 degrees which wasnt cooling the room at all and the room temperature was the same as before. A call to the reception and was promised that they will hunt for the correct remote so that the temperature of the Ac could be adjusted but needless to say that never happened.In the end we spent the night with a non functional Ac unit.Next day morning when i complained at the reception; they surprisingly found the correct remote and the second night was stress free.They waved off the charge for the first nite Ac ( rightfully so) and we ended up paying for one nite.It appears that the Hotel is severely under staffed;be it the restaurant or any other request.Everything takes for ever to be done.The food at the restaurant was ok but a bit on the expensive side for all it was worth.And it does take forever for your food to arrive.Service is very bad because they r severely understaffed and u almost feel sorry for the waiters who seem to be doing their best.At dinner time ; the restaurant was completely packed full as i believe there was a film crew who had checked in but there was just one waiter to manage a restaurant full of almost 80-90 people.It was chaos to say the least.The rooms are strictly ok and could do with better upkeep.We could see a few cob webs here n there and the curtains did have some stains.Now for the good part.LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!! Thats what its all about.The Location of this Hotel is fantastic.The view from the restaurant is breathtaking and from your room too if you have opted for the valley side room.You could just sit there all day.The hotel is very easy to locate too.They have a decent play area for the kids ; swimming pool and 2 tennis courts. My daughter had a lovely time there and so did the other kids and thats what matters in the end.All in all we had a good time at the ravine and yes i will return again simpy because you just cant beat the view from the hotel but next time i will be more prepared mentally to accept their short comings which we may experience.I sincerely hope that the hotel takes notice and does something about it.,via Web,Mar-12,with family,3,5,3,3,2,1,ace_sam_2000,"Navi Mumbai, India",12,10,10,1,2,NA,Dear Sir; Thank you for your sincere review on our hotel and bringing this matter to our attention.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Nice place”,4,5/19/2012,5/19/2012,Gone with family for an ultrashort holiday. Decided on it on the spur of the moment as it is the first hotel when you enter Panchgani. Was recommended by someone though. Was not sure whether room would be available in the peak season. Experience was good; room was great; very spacious and well laid out facing the tennis court and the valley. The only drawback was the extra bed provided was very creaky and the mattress was very uneven and lumpy. We had dinner in the restaurant; the food was good but the chicken was very hard and seemed undercooked. Overall; its a nice place to stay in though a bit pricey; also the restaurant. They charge extra for the AC which was surprising though you hardly need it. The property is well situated and huge. Takes time to explore especially around the tenting area. Nice place and would recommend it and like to visit it again. Room service is not very good.,via Web,May-12,with family,3,5,3,4,4,2,ashray70,pune,48,21,23,2,2,Room Tip: Choose the valley facing rooms on the upper floors.,Dear Sir;Thank you for your Positive review for our hotel.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Nice Hotel; bad people.”,3,5/18/2012,5/18/2012,Ravine has got a nice view and a good location but its just about that. The rooms are not well equipped with proper facilities compared to the money thay charge for the rooms. If you are looking for a hotel with good location and just about ok food; you might not be dissapointed but truly dont expect more.The staff is uncourteous. Though they say they belong to the hospitality industry; they are nothing close to being hospitable.Special mention to the manager Ms. Rajni; dealing with whom can easily be said to be the worst experience ever.Thanks to her; would not intend to revisit Ravine,via Web,May-12,with family,3,3,3,3,3,2,DebAsh1985,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r130156091-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Hotel with large property on hill side”,4,5/15/2012,5/15/2012,Hotel Ravine is an awesome place to slip over for a holiday for a day or 2. It has got huge expanse over the hill with a beautiful valley view on one side.2-3 tennis courts suffices the urge to play on valley side. Small but good swimming pool; large area for kids to play make it sufficient for all age groups to relax and enjoy.Food varirty is limited; but good. It charges 600/- extra for ac; this looks to be a down side. Its property is very large; so one can have a very beautiful valley view early in the morning or late evening with cool breeze.The spa experience is also amazing .Local market is around 1.5 kms away so one can go to the market to enjoy freshh strawberrys.,via Web,Apr-12,with family,4,5,4,3,4,3,khandelwalg,Pune,12,8,8,2,1,NA,Thank you for your wonderful review.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great place; Good rooms perfectly located.”,4,4/30/2012,4/30/2012,Had being to this hotel in Panchgani for summer chillout along with the family. It's a excellent Hotel; very good rooms; perfectly clean. Family rooms are in duplex format with children room on the first floor attached to the parent room. Location is very perfect. You can enjoy evening sunset in the mountains from the hotel itself. You get perfect view of the Dhom Dam valley on down side. Half the Salman Khan starrer Dabhang flim was shot on Dhom dam backwaters. May the Dabhang part II shooting is also expected on the same location hence you have many photographs of the entire Dabhang crew on this hotel web page as they had stayed in this hotel during the shoot.But irrespective of the stars; It's a very good hotel. Gym as well as swiming pools are well maintained. It's a perfect place for family with chindrens. Place around is very silent away from the busy streets. Sydney point is just behind this hotel. I would surely be visting this hotel again in later part of the year.,via Web,Apr-12,with family,4,5,4,4,4,4,DhanrajKalbhor,"Pune, India",57,35,31,1,3,NA,it gives us a great pleasure to read all your wonderful reviews and to know that you have enjoyed every bit of your stay in our hotel; we are expecting the Dabbang part2 team very soon and Ravine is Bollywood’s hotspot for all shooting schedules.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“very charming place”,4,4/19/2012,4/19/2012,Had been to Ravine a few years back (Dec 2009).The property is very big and they have a lot of facilities like the swimming pool; tennis court; disco etc.They also have tents; if you want a unique experience.The rooms are clean; the washrooms are very clean. The linen as well towels etc provided are also very clean. The room is not very spacious though.They have a valley facing restuarant. though we did not eat at the restuarant. Room service was a little slow; we had to remind them about the order also the menu for room service is very limited.The valley facing rooms have an excellent view and is worth the price you pay for it.All in all a very good proprty and I would say the best proprty in Panchgani.,via Web,May-11,with friends,4,5,5,4,4,4,rinkusarkar29,"Mumbai, India",56,16,17,4,NA,Room Tip: Valley facing rooms,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r128188160-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great views; nice rooms; better food would make it excellent”,4,4/16/2012,4/16/2012,Went for a long weekend and were only able to get garden side rooms as the hotel was booked full ... sadly for us. We picked a garden view room which wasnt bad as the window forms one complete side of the room so its nice and bright. The room has a reasonable amount of space and is well maintained. Toothbrushes dont form a part of the standard toiletries provided. The hotel itself has a ton of facilities - game room; 3 tennis courts; swimming pool and a spa. We used the TT table for a bit and was fun. For tennis you can rent the rackets/balls - shoes are a must!! The view itself is to die for ...you can see staright down the valley along with the river from the garden ..they have a nice sit out area on top of the hall they rent out for marriages and you can enjoy a nice quiet sunset from there... the same view is available from their dining room as well. Breakfast isnt part of the room tariff and left us a bit wanting. The taste was average and frankly a bit too expensive with breakfast costing more than dinner. We had Indian food for dinner and it was very nice ; the Chinese again left us wanting. FYI for alcohol enthusiasts - the hotel doesnt have a bar and does not serve any hard drinks.The location is the biggest plus of the hotel...its a 15min walk from the city center and the first hotel as soon as you enter panchgani.,via Web,Apr-12,as a couple,4,5,3,5,5,5,wonderin_wanderer,"Mumbai, India",14,13,13,1,1,Room Tip: Valley view rooms are the ones with the best views,We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and your positive reviews motivate us to improve our services further.

Panchgani has tons of hotel - literally. And selecting one was really tough. Frankly; I wasn't sure how good Ravine would be till we actually arrived there. Ravine is away from the busy Panchgani Market. On the way to Wai. Market is at a 15 minutes walking distance. Travel Desk arranged taxis for us. So we moved around with ease. The resort location is off the Panchgani / Mahabaleshwar area. So do expect to travel a bit. Ravine is a Huge Hotel. Rooms are clean. Bed is comfortable. Bathrooms are spacious and clean too. The staff was helpful too.The swimming pool is in the corner of the resort. Our kids enjoyed it and we too had fun splashing water around.We were very happy with our stay at Ravine Hotel overall - except one big thing - the restaurant. Other people have said this in earlier reviews; We would certainly like them to improve their breakfast as a good breakfast can set for a good day ahead.The taste of other ordered food from the restaurant too was just acceptable. We preferred to have our meals outside and had much better experience outside.Other than that; it was a memorable trip for us and Ravine Hotel provided an excellent laid back; clean and comfortable space for us to unwind after crazy days or night outs!,via Web,Mar-12,with friends,5,5,5,5,5,5,SofiaWatson,"Brossard, Quebec, Canada",1,NA,NA,2,2,Room Tip: Valley plus is best room according to me,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r127175020-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Ok Hotel Great Facade even Better Location”,3,01-11-2012,01/11/2012,The Hotel is right below Sydney point; just after the tourist tax collection. The parking is a bit cramped space for about 15 cars. It’s a two storied building.  I had informed the hotel that I would be arriving late. Checking in was not a problem at all. The lobby is nice and big with the restaurant at the rear. I had booked a valley side room and my expec tations were high. I was put up in Room No.206. The room was strictly ok. Very basic amenities and no wardrobe; you get a small ‘box’ below the Television to put in your luggage; the bottom of this box is taken up by a large Godrej electronic safe box (10x6x10). Most of your luggage stays on the floor; dressing table or on the center table. Lucky I was carrying only one duffel bag. The room had a split air-conditioner and a fan The wash room is ok; warm water 24 hrs which is a blessing. One more point to note; the room has a connecting door to Room 205. It seemed to me; they open up the doors for a big family; not a great room to stay in if you are a honeymooning couple. Next day morning I woke up and was anticipating a fabulous view of the valley while sipping my cup of tea. I opened the curtain which are full length and hide the fact that there are no full length French windows. The windows have a barricade wall inside which is 4 feet tall. No chance of looking at the valley while sipping tea. Look at the clouds. If you are staying here during summer you will have a very sunny stay. If you stand at the window you have a fabulous view of the river Krishna and the valley. You can also see the tennis courts from the rooms. We ordered teat Rs.25.00 per cup. Tea not great! Order the Kettle at Rs.50 it’s worth the money. We decided to take a tour of the hotel this is what I found. - The gardens are ok and the swimming pool not worth taking a dip. - The tennis courts are great - There is an Art Gallery which was closed during our visit - A mini theater - Gym ok - A restaurant After a days worth of shopping at Mahabaleshwar we came back tired. My wife did not want to go down to the restaurant to eat so decided to order room service. Big disappointments here; first they only serve starters and snacks in the room. We ordered a few starters and cold drinks. We informed room service to clear the plates and the service guy came the next morning. The food is so-so; the chicken crispy tastes like chicken chilly and the masala papad was soggy by the time it was delivered. For food you have to go down to the restaurant. One other thing I observed that drinking water takes its own time to come. I have stayed at different hotels and noticed that they always a jug of water with room service and take the old one out. The water was only replaced once and that too on request. The restaurant has one of the best views of the valley. The best place to sit and have a cup of steaming coffee and enjoy the scenery. The only plus point of this hotel is the restaurant. Sad that the restaurant is closed to non guests; I would have stayed somewhere else and come to the restaurant for my Tea.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“relaxed and refreshed !!”,4,9/14/2011,9/14/2011,a perfect weekend getaway with family and friends....we were a group of 4 headed to ravine hotel panchgani. it is without a doubt the best accomodation to stay at in all of mahabaleshwar and panchgani. all the more worth it if u can make a trip during the weekdays since the prices are relatively cheap. we had booked the ground floor valley room and must say it is perfect for 4 people. probably a little renovation here and there would help. but all in all on a scale of 10..would rate it at 8. food is expensive so its better to head out for meals. also its a good idea to have ur own vehicle since food joints are atleast 1-2 km away and mahabaleshwar is about 17-20 km away. the ground floor valley room has two TV's so thats a huge plus point; although its unlikely that one will have time to watch TV since the hotel has an outstanding gaming parlour and a state of the art gym. evenings can be spent playin pool; TT; tennis or air hockey. For the fitness freaks theres a full fledged gymnasium that can easliy boast of the latest equipments. The hotel has a viewing gallery which gives a breathtaking view of the lake and the entire valley. Since its located at Sydney point the view is to die for. One can sit for hours on end and take in the natural beauty and fresh air. On the flipside; hotel could have been much better if the upkeep and maintenance been more up to date. Some minor details like spanking clean linen is something that is expected if a hotel claims to be a 3 star property. But unfortunately one has to pester the hotel staff to get the same changed.

We stayed here for 2 nights. The unfortunate part was that we had not pre-booked the room and got only 1 deluxe valley view room and the other had to be a regular room. Thus we managed. The rooms were good and the staff was helpful. Pre-book the rooms in advance since it gets pretty sold out during this period. We pretty much ate out most of the times except maybe the last nights meal before we left and that was good. Also; the indoor games kept us busy. The only negative was the spa. My suggestion would be to check the treatment rooms before you get excited to use them. Even though the same Spa is there at Brightland; but the treatment rooms are far better there than here.

No requirement for AC though each room has one. The kids playing area; valley viewing deck; games room are great but when we went in june 2011 the swimming pool was not greatly maintained and hence had tons of flies.They have a very good facility for movie viewing for the family for just rs 200 per movie in a small theater hall with a wide variety of movies.Bournvita in room would cost about 85 rs in room and plain tea 40 rs per cup which is very pricely and not too great for taste. We found out some LUCKY bakery and restaurant in main town near the circle for some amazing brune bread (lots of variety of fresh bread) along with great tea and coffee. Stomach full of this breakfast costed us 80 Rs.This lucky restaurant is 1 km drive form ravine towards the city.No complementary breakfast; and the steep high pricing of food in the Ravine Restaurant were a turn down.Try purohit thali near the lucky restaurant and its not a miss. Extremely famous Jaffer bhais Delhi Darbar is also recently opened in panchgani for delicious biryanis and kababs.Ravine is indeed the palace of the winds. Not to be missed.

This hotel is on such a place where you can get all the views without going anywhere in the city.Reception staff is not so helpful and friendly. Neither are they adjusting. Restuarent is bad and service is delayed and horribly tiring though room service was much better. We did not get a room cos we went last moment without any prior bookings. Being a peak season we still managed to get the tents and now I know why they were not taken. because the tents are located at valley edge and it was so windy (hopefully only on the day we visited) their that the roof of teh tent keeps going up-down & guup guup all night. We couldn't manage to sleep much but the weather was so awesome that we didn't feel tired at all. Don't take tents if you love your sleep though. But its a pleasure to stay in them.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good stay”,4,07-01-2011,07/01/2011,We decided to drive down to Panchgani from Pune and stay there for 3 days before the Summer Season. We chose the Ravine Hotel on account of its location (just besides a valley). One has to book in advance during season time. Overall; it was a fairly good experience. The rooms are good considering that not too many hotels in Panchgani are large; the food at the restaurant is superb and there is enough to do at the hotel when one does not want to roam around the hill station or the points. It is better to get to the restaurant for any of the 3 meals a little earlier to get the best tables facing the valley; and your food on time. Other facilities used by us included the tennis courts (hardcourts); swimming pool and trampoline. The pool is nice; the courts can be used when not too sunny; and the kids freaked out at the trampoline with nets surrounding it. Parking facilities are there in the hotel; though a little congested in case there is a heavy rush. Also; Sydney point is very close from where one can get a good view of the valley and Panchgani lake.For people who love early morning or early evening walks; distance from the Hotel towards the Panchgani market takes about 30 minutes; and is besides the road.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Nice little hotel with amazing views & decent activities.”,4,6/16/2011,6/16/2011,Ravine is one of the few good hotels in Panchgani. You have to visit in the right season. If its cloudy; rainy & misty then there's no better place than Ravine. The valley facing rooms offer outstanding views of the huge valley. The rooms are of decent size & decent interiors. The bathrooms are small but manageable. Although the doors need some renovation but overall its fine. The food is alright (not as bad as some other reviews). They have tennis courts; swimming pool & indoor games for time passing. The service is quick & prompt. Overall I recommend this hotel in Panchgani.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great Location: Service should improve”,3,5/25/2011,5/25/2011,"We were two young couples travelling together with two kids aged under 3. The location of the hotel is awesome; and that is what made us choose that place during an earlier trip to Panchgani. The rooms were well appointed and cosy. Room service was ok; travelling with two kids we expected room service for meals as well; which was not given. The restaurant downstairs; overlooks the valley; so a splendid sight. Food quality; and portions are not that great; especially for the price you pay. Judging by the food served; it seems like the kitchen is not run by professional chefs. Service is slow; but then again; this is hill-station; so we should not be expecting a city-like efficiency.There is a better restaurant Cliff Inn next door; which serves actual restaurant-like food; with tandoor etc and seems more professionally managed; even thought it is attached to its own resort. . i have read many reviews on tripadvisor.com regarding the poor experience of some travellers while interacting with the owner of Ravine; Panchgani.Narrating from my experience; whilst checking out; a young man at the reception asked us if we enjoyed our stay; we gave him honest feedback; with a sugestion that they could look into the bed size which we found was smaller in some rooms (in one of the two rooms we booked; the couple and the 3 yr old child found it a bit uncomfortable to sleep on a smaller bed). Whilst the young man took the feedback as intended; a very senior looking manager standing nearby perhaps overheard and felt offended; and rather unkindly told us that these beds were meant for couples so don't expect to accomodate a child on the same bed. Strange words from someone in the Service Industry. It would have been better to stay quiet rather than respond like this.

We decided to take non valley facing rooms since valley facing rooms were occupied.

The location of the hotel is terrific and you can just laze around with a book or enjoy the indoor games without any need to look outside for entertainment. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the Childrens park is very well maintained. watching the sunset from the hotel is a very peaceful experience.The only thing to bear in mind is that you are on a holiday so likewise make allowances for the service which is not as fast as us city folks would expect. Service is rather slow and laid back but polite none the less.The food at the restaurant \Melting Pot\"" is really tasty; authentic and of good quality. It is a little expensive but that is off set by the consistently good quality. We tried all the cuisines available and were happy with all the preparations.The most striking thing about this hotel is the honesty of the staff. I had forgotten my Fast track watch behind. Initially i had thought of writing to the hotel but dismissed the idea as i was not expecting my watch back. Within 3 days of check out the hotel proactively called me up and informed me that they had sent the watch to their Mumbai office and i could collect it from there.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Horrible - Thats all I can say...”,1,4/25/2011,4/25/2011,It has been the worst experience till date with this hotel. Before I start with the worse; lets get to the good things. The Good: The location / view is excellent;the tennis courts are well maintained and the Spa is value for money. And this is where it ends. The rooms were quite clean and the room was was cozy. The Bad: The room service is horrible with people not attending for more than hour. We were waiting in the pool for about half an hour before any one could get us few towels. We had to wait for an hour for Tea in the room and when it arrived it was cold. The food is less than average I would recommend you to avoid add try other hotels. The swimming pool was unclean with dead flies floating in the pool. The Ugly: Booking rooms in Ravine was an horrendous experience. First they said that they would be able to give me 2 rooms of my choice as rooms were available and I need to book over the internet. I did the same in the next half hour and was supposed to receive an email within 24 hours. Did not receive anything for 48 hours and then an email saying that their Amex Card machine is not working and if I can provide them with another card they would be able to go ahead an book. I reply to the email within minutes for which I get a reply saying that the rooms are not available as they have been given out to people who had actually sent a request after me. Later I called up and spoke to a senior who offered us two rooms for 18K with an email confirmation of the same. But to our horror when we went for final settlement the bill had become 25k. They said they had calculated the same by mistake which is acceptable but when they accused that we knew about the tariffs and we purposely did not mention it to them it got to me. The experience was disgusting and hope no one has the same ever. It spoilt the whole holiday which had been so much of fun till that point.,via Web,Apr-11,with family,1,5,1,3,4,1,UtkalPatra,"Mumbai, India",15,15,14,2,8,Room Tip: Avoid the restuarant.,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r105352657-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Ravine Hotel Satara,“Great views and layout; but service needs some serious make over.”,2,04-07-2011,04/07/2011,We planned to stay at Ravine for a weekend of peace and calm. It was far from that. There was a wedding across the road and the music blared from afternoon to late into the night. We requested to the reception to tell them to reduce the sound and they just laughed it off. It was only after a person message to the owner's son did they send someone across and actually got them to reduce the volume.The reception staff needs a lot of brushing up in hospitality.The hotel itself had a stunning location with wonderful views of the valley. We stayed in a Jr. Executive room on the second floor. The hotel does not have a guest lift and hence we had to trudge up a steep staircase. The room itself was large and spacious and well appointed. However ; there were large mosquitoes and no provision to get rid of them. Also the air conditioners have this bright eerie blue light which glows all night and makes it impossible to sleep.The shower area was extremely squeezed and we had difficulty getting in breadth wise.We ordered room service and found the food to be inconsistent. On the first day lunch was fabulous and so was the breakfast the following day. However; the day of check out half the items on the menu were not available and overall the service was terrible. For example; the waiters would barge into the room without knocking; the bellboy was missing on checkout and the front office staff; the lesser said the better.Overall; the hotel is would be considered a little steeply priced for the service but would justify the cost by the amenities around the property which include tennis courts; a swimming pool etc.We researched other hotels in Panchgani during that stay and found Ravine to be the best in terms of room comfort but lacking highly on service and hospitality. A point to note. The outpost camping tents seem to be promising and we would try them out in the cooler season; assuming the service improves and people here on tripadvisor here have something good to say about it before we go.,via Web,Mar-11,as a couple,2,5,1,2,2,1,gobeyondtravels,"Mumbai, India",53,32,26,3,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r103193588-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

The room and the bathroom were clean with good facilities. Service was prompt and efficient and the staff was courteous. The size of the room was quite small given the tariff. However; the view more than made up for the smaller size.Another plus I would like to mention is their restaurant.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Amazing Location with Pathetic Service”,1,1/18/2011,1/18/2011,I have been visiting Panchgani almost every second year and Ravine was a hotel about which I had heard great reviews from family and friends. So this time around I decided to book it for my 2n/3d stay with my friends.The location of the resort is undoubtedly one of the best you can have in Panchgani & Mahabaleshwar. We took the Ground Floor Valley View Room as it were 3 people in all and the room can accommodate upto 4. The interiors of the room are very well done including the furniture and the bathroom. Their pricing is exclusive of A/C use; so ensure you calculate the total cost accordingly. Add to this; the room was continuously stinking from the time we checked in and post complaining for 2 days is when they realized that their sewage system wasn't working properly. The room service was very irregular.We visited the place during the off season and hence I would say that we almost got our money's worth.The food is really good. However; the price is a bit steep and the quantity they serve per plate is marginal and unsatisfactory. When it came to services and amenities; the hotel was a total disappointment. All their services had weird timings restrictions including the pool; game room; billiards. Now when I go for vacation; I prefer not to get up at 7 in the morning so that I can play a bit of billiards. On questioning the front desk for an explanation for such timings; all I got was a complaint card which ofcourse was returned blank by me as I knew any feedback would be a waste. The hotel did not have any staff at the managerial position and when asked to speak to a higher authority i.e. the owner (who stays in the hotel itself I guess); I was told to wait as he was in a meeting. For 2 days and a couple of follow ups; I did not hear from the owner. I am guessing his meeting went on for a bit too long.Keeping that aside; the overall experience was very unsatisfactory specially due to the illogically hotel policies and un-cooperative staff.,via Web,Oct-10,with friends,1,4,2,2,1,1,kunalbahl,"Mumbai, India",23,14,19,2,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r93541289-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Ravine Hotel Satara,“This could be so much more.”,2,01-12-2011,01/12/2011,I usually see Indian people go out on a complete bashing spree when they review anything. Although my experience was bitter overall for the amount of money I paid. I really do love this place. Let me list out whats what.I had to pay the highest possible price (on-season lasted till a day more when I checked in.) They were generous enough to offer 30% overall discount on stay. Also the 10% luxury tax was waived off.The hotel cannot be called a 3 star property; it has to be viewed as a quaint family owned property and it should cater to that market. I loved the bed and valley view room that I stayed in. Also the furnishings in the room were (relatively) tastefully done.The bad things :A/C Charges ExtraWiFi in lobby never worked even after repeated requests.Arrogant elderly man at reception; the others were very warm and friendly;TV of bad qualityInconsistency in luxuryNo room serviceExpensive Spa (relative)I would definitely stay there again even though I had a bad experience; my family and I have been going there for years and years.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Rude; Arrogant Owner - Unfriendly hotel”,1,12/19/2010,12/19/2010,The only good thing about this hotel is the scenic views that it gives. Apart from that everything is the worst. They claim to be 3 star property; but it is not at all near to that. everything in the hotel closes down by 10.30 PM; and you wont get anything after that - even tea; coffee or colddrinks ! The reception is utterly slow and takes long time to get things done from them. The policies of the hotel are pretty weird - like game room only available from 7pm to 10pm (thts the time we are always outside; - game room is most needed in afternoons); food not served in rooms; etc. We had booked a Valley Plus room; but on our arrival it was not ready. We agreed that we would downgrade to valley side room which was ready that time. Much to our amazement; the hotel was not ready to adjust the balance amount into our total bill . Not getting the room ready was our mistake ? !!! Also On phone; we were told that people who rent a room would also get access to the bonfire place along with the tent owners. But after paying for the room; they simply denied saying anything of this sort !!!!The worst part of the hotel is the owner... he was the most rude and arrogant person I have ever met in my life. He was not ready to even listen to our problem. He kept blaming us for not been intuitive enough. He even said he doesn't care and the system here is like this; and cannot be changed.It was the worst experience ever for me; with any hotel - I ever stayed in.,via Web,Nov-10,with family,1,3,3,3,1,1,khinvasara_anand,Pune,3,3,3,1,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r90195372-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT
Ravine Hotel Satara,“Excellent Hotel - But Keep Away From Tents !!!!”,4,12/14/2010,12/14/2010,"We visited Hotel Ravine in December for two nights. The booking was done through the Bombay Office. Mr Bharat in the Bombay Office was very efficient in guiding us through the phone for reserving two Executive Rooms for us; being a family of 4 ! The hotel is ideally located; overlooking the valley and the Krishna River and just a stone throw from the Sydney point.The Executive Rooms was simply mind blowing !!! Awesome view with all the amenities. The room keeps one enchanted through the day and this is simply one of the best you can get anywhere ! Each Executive Room actually has two rooms; each with a King size bed and attached bath and TV's and identical views. The bath has a bathtub. Both rooms have 36\ LCD TVs and are well furnished. The rooms also give breathtaking views of paragliding as the view provides a closeup of the glidepath while taking off and landing. The hotel has a small pool - best avoided in winters as the water is ice cold and a game room too. Most of the video games are non operational. However; there are two pool tables available. Also table tennis facility is available but with broken rackets and peeling table. Yet; my girls had their share of fun too ! Game coins (Rs 5 each) can be purchased from the reception. I found the restaurant to be very good - a tad expensive but well stocked; maintained and with smart service. We had dinner from the hotel restaurant on all three days and quite relished the fare provided. Preferred to have our Breakfast and Lunch from other hotels during sight seeing. Free Wi-Fi is accessible in the hotel lobby. We visited the 'serenity' spa on all three days. The Spa provides a wide variety of services. The Aromatherapy is particularly good. The staff is courteous and gives good service. For Hotel Guests; an additional 15 % discount is given on the advertised rates. Couldn't visit the gym though ! The hotel charges different rates for Mon - Thur and Fri - Sun. Based on the first two days fabulous experience; we decided to extend our stay by another night - and had to settle for Kings Tent in the outpost (which is about 10 m below the main hotel building) as all Executive Rooms were booked out for the weekend. Kings Tent is advertised as a Luxury Tent (4 occupants) - but is best avoided if you are traveling with the family in winter ! The tent has a kingsize bed and two additional cots which are tucked under the main bed. Each and every equipment inside the tent has been chosen to give the 'rustic' feel - starting from the old black switches; to the copper pots and mugs in the bathroom and the table / chairs made of logs - however the ancient videocon television/ broken remote and the aged telephone instrument looked out of place in the so called luxury tent. The nights are quite chilly and the tents offer little warmth. The bath tub in the tent gave creeps with little 'crawlies' roaming about. If traveling alone or for adventure; tent may prove interesting - but considering that the kings tent and the executive rooms are comparatively priced; the tent offers poor value for money. Yet at the end of the day; its a great hotel with a great spa; great view; great rooms and great food ! The room service can definitely improve to live upto the three star rating.""",via Web,Dec-10,with family,4,5,4,4,4,3,miatom,"Visakhapatnam (Vizag), India",3,3,3,8,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r89828041-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

We could not decide between who was worse amongst the lot: the extraordinarily rude and obnoxious owner; the ruder restaurant staff; or the not so timely room service staff. The rooms were sub-standard; with no hot water for an entire day. Never got anyone to attend to it even after hours of filing the complaint. The bed in my in laws room broke at midnight! The showers had no pressure. I still think we would have endured it all; had it not been for the owner who was barking at almost every customer who walked in through the door.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Good hotel to stay with Family”,4,11-05-2010,11/05/2010,I went to ravine inn to spend the weekend on my birthday. went there with my family. I had researched some bit while booking hotels as i wanted to make sure that the hotel which we stay are good as my family was me. I could book the hotel online via credit card ; which is great. the hotel is just 10 mins away from the market; 15 mins walk to the market area (which i dont prefer) but I took my car so that was not an issue. the entrance lobby is good and clean. had posters of aamir khan and other bollywood celebritites that had also visited the hotel. we had booked the main valley facing rooms so on entering the room i was happy to find a great view. The view that it offered was gr8. the room had other usual facility like LCS tv; nice decor and good bathrooms. there are tent options that you can utlise but i prefered the valley facing rooms over the tent. there is a basement games room; a tennis court in the hotel; which is good. i played some pool which is located at the basement. coming to the food; i didnt find much on the menu and whatever was there wasnt too good (atleast for the value) so I would suggest you have a car with you; you can go to market and have good food. in the night; hotel had arranged for a paid view of stars through the telescope.overall the experience was good; and barring the food; i like the hotel and would like to visit it again with my family.,via Web,Jan-10,with family,4,3,4,4,4,3,jaymandalia,"Mumbai, India",3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297653-d537730-r86095390-Ravine_Hotel-Panchgani_Maharashtra.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT

They also have a nice sit-out area from where you can look at the valley.There are two tennis courts; an indoor game center and a spa at the hotel. We tried out their spa. The massage was good (not great). It can be tried after a long day of sightseeing.Just next to the hotel; on the cliff; operators provide a chance for paragliding. If you are afraid of heights; you can sit out in the lawn and watch other paragliders sail by over the valley.

The food sucks and the menu offers only chicken and paneer (cattage cheese); and the preparations were nothing to rave about.

Ravine Hotel Satara,“Hotel Ravine; Panchgani”,4,1/28/2009,1/28/2009,We returned from Panchgani last week (jan 19-22/2009)and i can close my eyes and still feel the fresh mountain air flowing through my lungs. But have to come out of my slumber cos i know we are back again in very polluted mumbai. I stay in thane and me & my wife travelled on one pleasantly cold monday morning for our 3 nights 4 days trip to panchgani & mahableshwar. The journey was fantastic since i took along my car and reached panchgani in exacly 4hrs.15min (including 30 minutes spend at a roadside eatery) at hotel ravine.Oh..it was my first experience of panchgani and ofcourse Ravine.So how do i think the hotel is??? Well they call themselves 3 star hotel and truth be told the hotel stays true to that.It is indeed 3 star with all the necessary amenities. But the major attraction apart from its 3 star status is its location. A stunning view from the hotel of deep ravines; picturesque hamlets and a flowing river all make for a paisa vasool (vfm...value for money) getaway. We saw many foreigners staying at the hotel in this off-peak season (try it cos rates are almost 50% less in off season) so i cannot imagine how crowded it must be in the peak season.The service was good and the staff was also very helpful. The hotel is clean (yes even the bathrooms are spotless) and airy because of its beautiful location. One big plus is the magnificent view the hotel restaurant offers with endless mountains; deep gorges and the stunning krishna river which keeps you reminding you are actually seated on edge of a mountain. Any negative points? yes; lack of ventilation in the bathroom (needs an exhaust) and yes the very pricey hotel restaurant. But i can overlook the fact that the target customers are foreigners for whom per dish will hardly cost 4 USD . Cheap for them. Convert that to indian rupees and we start comparing with every normal indian eateries we go to!!! So do not fret; try the panchgani market area which is 1.5kms away from here for normal indian & chinese food. Again; there is ample parking space and it is also near to the panchgani market area. So you cannot go wrong on this....if you plan to make a trip to panchgani give Hotel Ravine a try....you won't be disappointed.

That is how we felt when we landed up there cause nobody mentioned anything about renovation etc. What a waste cause they really have a great location and could have done so much with it. Anyways; bottom line we walked out of the place (2 families with a total of 4 kids in tow) in spite of the manager charging our credit card for Rs 2300 as some sort of cancellation fee which we will dispute!

Nothing lavish or extraordinary.Bed is comfyPricing is neither cheap neither costly;100% payment to be done for booking thru the website; which is strange.They manage to book a safari at minimal extra cost in advisable zones in the last hour. So it seems they have good contact as we visited when there was maximum rush in the park.ALL hotels are located on the same 5 km stretch of Ranthambore road. The road lacks proper transportation. The whole city also dsnt has any nice place to do shopping or eating out. Hence most hotels offer MAP plans.

Bathroom was clean though.Unfortunately they did not provide any heater & in night it became terribly cold & even with our sweaters; jacket & blanket we felt very very cold.The tent was very basic with just a bed & a chair.Outside the tent they had 2 chairs placed just to sit & enjoy your morning tea.Food though was really tasty & staff was helpful.They arranged a bon fire for us & also got us safari tickets booked in last moment.Overall for those who like adventure can plan to stay in the tent.

But the tent was freezing at 8ish ... which we took to kill time while waiting for a room to be vacated.We infact enjoyed the sun outside the tent which was more than welcome relief from the Jan chill!We finally checked in at 9 and the room was decent with minor irritants here and there but then keeping in mind the Govt tag ... you can and should ignore them;lest to make the trip go sour.But yes... when pointed out to a couple of things which needed replacement;the same were managed promptly!Breakfast and dinner being a part of the package were buffet only ... were decent enough but only 1 non-veg item in Dinner was a bad hit.There was bonfire in the evening just outside the dining hall which was enjoyed by almost all guests present there.One can go to the terrace of the hotel from where the hills in the back are visible and so is another hotel asmongst the hills only run by RTDC.All in all ... its a decent Govt run property with decent rooms and food ... and a very well maintained lawn in the front.Had booked for the safari online;but one can make arrangements thru the hotel reception itself.

RTDC Hotel Vinayak Ranthambore_National_Park,“Not worth the price at all !!!”,2,10-09-2013,10/09/2013,Hi;The hotel charges are above average (3000/- starting excluding taxes). However the rooms; quality; service etc. are quite below the mark. 1. The rooms are very old fashioned (poor flooring; old marble tiles in the bathroom)2. Hot water managed to come through only after a brief fight with the staff and then a brief struggle by the staff with the plumbing.3. Finally the icing on the cake. We had an additional un-invited guest partner -> a rat; which was respectfully called as 'Chachundar' (called 'shrew' in English) by the staff upon we complaining. Additionally all stories were concocted stating that it has been living there for many generations and cannot be driven out easily. Also the fact that the animal was worshipped by the locals. Hence it was our extreme fortune for having shared a room with the creature.4. A lot of money is fleeced without proper receipts (safari; local gypsy; local auto etc.) 5. Food -> no choice and have to eat what's cooked. Dripping in oil; poor in quality; cleanliness and taste.My point is only that for Rs.3000/- excluding taxes; we expect something much more than the above.The general Tripadvisor ratings prompted us to choose this hotel. However it has turned out to be a total let down.

The service from the staff and general hospitality was top notch as usual..Was stunned to see 2 additional charges of Rs. 700 each added to my bill on the last morning .. One was for a double occupancy of a room mate that had left earlier in the day and the management was informed about it being a single occupancy well in advance.. Secondly was for some additional meal charges that were not incurred...

The location is nice; the rooms clean (we stayed in the AC rooms) and comfortable. But the best part was the service we received. Having stayed in a lot of RTDC properties earlier in Jaisalmer; Jodhpur; Jaipur and Mount Abu; it was really an unbelievable service level that we saw here. With small kids; we made many requests; hot milk; cold milk; non spicy food etc etc and the staff was always ready to help with a smile. In fact they specially made Rajma chawal for a buffet dinner to cater to the young ones in the hotel. The grounds are well kept and have some play area for the kids. For 2 days that we stayed there; except for the morning safari; we didn't need to step put of the hotel. In the evenings we would step into the ground for a couple of hours of playtime. Even though the hotel is surrounded with forest area; we didn't find mosquitoes in the rooms. For the price you pay here; the hotel is so worth it.

On arrival late at night; I was greeted by the very friendly and helpful manager who not only checked us in; but did all the paper work for our National Park safaris within minutes. This service is provided free of charge and saves a lot of running around. Our room was on the first floor which has a nice terrace overlooking the front lawns where one can relax. The rooms themselves are very decent; although the furniture and TV showed its age. It is a budget hotel after all; and you spend most of the time in the jungle; so this should not distract from your visit. Our room windows opened out to the back of the hotel; which is the boundary of the National Park. At night; I was awakened by the roar of a tiger; and next morning locals told us of the kill it had made a kilometer or so away near the main road to the park. The food here is very decent; and you can have your breakfast after you return from your morning safari. The staff will be happy to provide a wake up service with tea to help prepare for the early morning start for the safari. The jeeps turn up at the hotel to pick you up. The hotel also has a private souvenir shop selling wildlife themed hats/caps/tshirts; books; DVDs etc. The prices were cheaper than what the vendors charge you at the entrance to the National Park. Internet access for guests is provided free if you ask nicely to use the reception PC.

Our room was infested with ants (big Indian ants; remember) which were all over the floor and scaling the toilet seat as well. The room besides the ants; was acceptable. The food was far from nice; although the breakfast was OK. They were helpful with organising safaris but this was also expensive. All of these aspects are commonplace in quite a few budget hotels in India and although they are not what you want your hotel that you're staying at to be like; you come to expect it when travelling India on the cheap. Except the Vinayak isn't especially cheap and the worst experience of all was one of the drunk staff members trying to force his way into my room in which my girlfriend was lying on the bed in; half-naked.

It is located away from all the other hotels so is relatively more peaceful.The kitchen staff was often reluctant to serve dinner early (served after 8.30pm). We had made online bookings for the safari and were a little confused about how we would pay the fee for the canter/guide (that was not charged while making the online booking).You are expected to pay this fee very early in the morning at the Ranthambore Office (located about 5-6 kms away from the hotel). If the fee is not paid on the morning of the safari; the Park authorities cancel your online booking.The most convenient way to handle this is to get in touch with the reception staff. They take about INR 405 per person (330 for the petrol canter; 25 for the guide... and the remaining is a commission I guess!).

Its very close to the jungle and provides a beautiful backdrop from the terrace - the staff is courteous and helpfulAnd then there are things which can certainly do with some improvement: - biggest among them is food. very basic fare available. Items on menu are not available at all times and the taste can also definitely be improves - the stay can be made more comfortable with modernising the rooms and bathrooms a bit (one plug point is simply not adequate in these days of multiple gadgets)That said; the hotel has to find ways of making the travellers stay more interesting. Ranthambore doesnt have anything besides the national park (and the fort / temple).

Decent helpful staff. Swiss tents are a option but not very secure due to the cloth flap door (the bathrooms attached to the Swiss tents are good and clean). Food was decent and tasty. Biggest (and only) problem was that for any change to the Safari booking; getting local transport to the Forest Booking office sowntown was a painful thing to arrange. If you do booking the safari online from before; the Hotel sends a chap on your behalf to do this; so it is not very troublesome in that case. BUT if you have to make any chages to a online booking; then you have to do it yourself and it becomes very difficult to do. Got very good tips on wildlife viewing spots.

We were really amazed to see the cleanliness maintained in the kitchen though it wasnt like the one of a five star but it had maintained basic cleanliness. The food is amazingly simple and satisfying.

Though they dont have a wide spread menu their food is satisfying for our taste buds. They also book canter seats for your safaris and also arrange for taxis if you feel like oaming locally.
