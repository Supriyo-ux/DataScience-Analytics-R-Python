Business Probelm:
Motive of the business is based on the status of the customer whether the person is enable for loan or not.
 They have used specific code credit and the model help
 them to analyses that every person seeking for loan if they are default or not. 
 This model helps to find the defaulter list and reject them immediately to get the loan.




In logistic regression, we fit a regression curve, y = f(x) where y represents a categorical variable. 
This model is used to predict that y has given a set of predictors x. Hence, the predictors can be continuous, categorical or a mix of both.

It is a classification algorithm which comes under nonlinear regression. We use it to predict a binary outcome (1/ 0, Yes/ No, True/ False) given as a set of independent variables. Moreover, it helps to represent binary/categorical outcome by using dummy variables.

It is a regression model in which the response variable has categorical values such as True/False or 0/1. Therefore, we are able to measure the probability of the binary response. 

Syntax and Expression of R Logistic Regression
The general mathematical equation for logistic regression is:

y = 1/(1+e^-(a+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+â€¦))

Following is the description of the parameters used:

y is the response variable.
x is the predictor variable.
a and b are the coefficients which are numeric constants.
We use the glm() function to create the regression model and also get its summary for analysis.
